🌟 Meet the Vision & Values

Welcome to a space where clarity meets creativity, and healing walks hand-in-hand with action.

Visionary In Progress is more than a membership—it’s a movement rooted in softness, structure, and soul.
Here, we honour how you build just as much as what you build.

💫 Our Mission
To support women—especially Black women and women of colour—as they heal, build, and lead with intention using soulful tech, creativity, and gentle strategy.
We don’t just dream—we design lives and legacies that honour our values and capacity.

🗣 Our Voice
Grounded. Compassionate. Clear.
We speak in soft power, not pressure. We’re not here to hype you up—we’re here to hold you down with tools, truth, and tenderness.

You’ll hear words like rhythm, reflection, and rest just as much as revenue or reach. Because here, they coexist.

🤝 Our Culture
We are anti-performance and pro-progress.
We build in public but with purpose.
We show up as we are.
We prioritise emotional safety, cultural alignment, and ease.
We create room for both grief and growth, softness and structure.

💖 Our Four Brand Pillars
Everything inside this space connects to one (or more) of these transformation portals:

🔮 Create & Curate
For the dreamers, artists, and aesthetic minds.
Visual expression, AI art, digital tools, and beauty as a blueprint for healing.

👑 Live & Lead
For the soft leaders and life designers.
Rituals, gentle planning, lifestyle templates, and soul-aligned decision-making.

🛠 Build & Grow
For the quiet builders and digital visionaries.
Branding tools, income systems, automation support, and a structure that honours your energy.

🖋 Write & Reflect
For the feelers and journal keepers.
Prompts, grief rituals, self-therapy systems, and emotional clarity through writing.

🌱 What “In Progress” Really Means
We chose the name Visionary In Progress on purpose.
Because perfection isn’t the goal, movement is.

This is a space for the one who’s still figuring it out.
The one who’s pivoting, pausing, or piecing things together in between school runs, deep sighs, and sacred wins.

You are still a visionary—even when you’re not posting, producing, or planning.

You are allowed to bloom gently.

📜 The VIP Manifesto
You are not behind. You are blooming on your own timeline.
You are not invisible. You are a Visionary.
We don’t chase hustle—we embrace rhythm.
We don’t just learn tech—we soulfully integrate it.
Healing and growth are intertwined.
Your story, your structure, your legacy—it all matters.
Together, we create, reflect, build, and lead—
with power, softness, and soul.
