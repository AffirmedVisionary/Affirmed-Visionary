_Last updated: July 23, 2025_

## Welcome, Visionary! ✨  
By joining Visionary In Progress, you’re stepping into a soft yet powerful space built for digital creators, AI-curious minds, and soulful productivity seekers — especially Black women and women of colour who crave rhythm over rush. These Terms and Conditions outline what you can expect from us, and what we kindly ask of you in return.

---

## 1. Membership Expectations  
We hold community care at the centre. By joining, you agree to:

- Engage respectfully with all members  
- Refrain from harassment, discrimination, or harmful behaviour  
- Avoid spamming or unsolicited promotion  
- Honour the values of compassion, integrity, and intentional creation  

We reserve the right to remove anyone who does not align with these values — no refunds will be issued in such cases.

---

## 2. Payment Terms  

- Membership is billed monthly or annually depending on your selected plan.  
- All digital content (including GPTs, images, templates, replays, and downloads) is non-refundable.  
- If your payment fails or is cancelled, your access will be automatically revoked until resolved.  
- You are responsible for ensuring your payment method remains active and up to date.

---

## 3. Access Rights  

- Your membership is for you only. Please do not share your login or content with others.  
- Redistribution, reselling, or uploading of any materials outside the community is strictly prohibited.  
- Group purchases or team logins must be arranged with the admin in advance.

---

## 4. Content Licensing  

All content shared inside Visionary In Progress — including but not limited to videos, workshops, PDFs, templates, GPT tools, and art packs — is for personal use only. You may not:

- Copy, rebrand, resell, or publicly share any content  
- Use community-generated content in your own products or trainings without written permission  

If you’re unsure what’s allowed, just ask. We want to support your growth, not police it — but we do protect our contributors and creatives.

---

## 5. Affiliate Disclaimer  

Some resources shared inside the community may include affiliate links. If you choose to purchase via these links:

- You will never be charged more  
- We may receive a small commission that supports the running of this space  
- All affiliate links will be disclosed clearly and honestly

---

## 6. Platform Limitations  

Visionary In Progress is hosted on Skool, a third-party platform. As such:

- We are not responsible for Skool's system outages, technical issues, or platform changes  
- If Skool experiences downtime or maintenance, we will update you as soon as possible  
- By joining, you agree to Skool’s own terms and policies

---

## 7. Termination Clause  

We reserve the right to remove or restrict access to any member who:

- Violates these Terms and Conditions  
- Engages in behaviour that harms the integrity of the space  
- Attempts to misuse or exploit community tools and resources  

No refunds will be issued in cases of termination due to breach of terms.

---

## 8. Limitation of Liability  

Visionary In Progress is provided “as-is” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not guarantee any specific outcomes or results from participation in the community. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Visionary In Progress and its team shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including but not limited to data loss, interruption of access, or dissatisfaction with services.

---

## 9. Dispute Resolution  

If any dispute arises out of these Terms, both parties agree to attempt informal resolution first. If a resolution cannot be reached, the dispute may be submitted to mediation, arbitration, or small claims court in accordance with English law. Legal proceedings will be conducted in the courts of England and Wales.

---

## 10. Governing Law  

These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. Any legal action or proceedings related to this agreement shall be brought exclusively in the courts of England and Wales.

---

## 11. Amendments & Updates  

We may update these terms from time to time to reflect community growth or platform changes.

- All updates will be posted within the Skool community  
- Continued use of the space after updates implies acceptance  

If you ever have questions, we welcome dialogue — this is a co-created space.

---

## Closing Notes  

This isn’t just a legal document — it’s a mutual agreement. You are not just a customer here, but a co-creator. Thank you for honouring the boundaries that make this space safe, inspiring, and sustainable.

**You’re not behind — you’re just in progress.**
