Well, talk about the things that they talked about today. I am so sold on AI because of the way Alicia teaches this
0:05
stuff. The way she gives it makes it hands-on, makes it accessible, makes you know that you can do it. And not only
0:11
can you do it for yourself, but you can go out and help other people change their lives. This event today for me has
0:16
been monumental. I'm looking forward to the exact next time I can get together, be in the presence of these people. Why?
0:22
because it's going to help so many more people to grasp onto AI and to do the things that they need to do to make
0:27
their lives the very best they've ever been. I'm telling you, I had a blast today at
0:33
the AI consultant experience. I mean, it was a treat. I mean, we started off
0:39
with, you know, breakfast. They had us and we had breakfast and um which was wonderful. And then then we had the
0:46
podcast. Um, that podcast was just amazing to have that experience live.
0:52
And then we had a master class downstairs and I walked away with some nuggets. I walked away with meeting some
0:58
sisters, some brothers and I'm just thrilled to see what's to come and I'm
1:04
excited about everything that I've learned today and just just propelling
1:09
just taking off like a rocket. And Alicia has transformed my life when it comes to the AI game. the things that
1:15
we are implementing within the childcare industry is going to be amazing, unstoppable. What I learned right now,
1:21
we're networking. We're networking with a lot of people is amazing. At least you just knocked it out the box. So, I wish
1:27
that anyone that wants to learn or not say wish, I I just want to let you guys
1:33
know if you want to learn more about AI, she is the one for it. This is a program. Everyone here is like family.
1:40
Everyone here was amazing. So definitely locked in and just level up. I first saw Alysia on Facebook and from
1:48
there I attended the virtual summit and then I joined the AI consultant program
1:54
where I have learned so much information in a very short period of time. Alicia is the vessel of change and if you are
2:01
on the fence about joining the consultant program, don't be. Do it now.
2:07
Do it fast. Thanks. Today, let me tell you, today was amazing. I learned so
2:14
much. I think the number one thing that I learned was that I cannot put myself down. I'm worth something and I have to
2:22
tell people about it.
2:51
I've been around AI and technology for a very long time. The way Alysia has
2:57
situated and created this beautiful environment ecosystem for us to learn
3:02
in, it has not only changed my life, it's changed my daughter's life. It's going to change my mom's life. It's
3:08
going to change my aunt's life. I'm overjoyed and I'm grateful. So, so very grateful. Thank you. Thank you.
3:14
The most impactful part about being here, I feel like success low speed. So, I was able to just see a lot of the systems that I want to implement in my
3:20
business. Today, I got enough time to tour a seed for a time for the whole year. It was value after value after value after
3:26
value. The experience was luxurated creme deer creme. We just had to be in
3:31
the building. He had to be in the room. Today's event was just very impactful. I really can't even put words on it. The
3:37
amount of information I got with Alicia and then all the guest speakers. Next level is Alicia has changed my life
3:46
in ways that you could never imagine. I'm a video producer and editor. Alicia's live event has been amazing to
3:55
help give me some groundwork, give me the foundation of learning AI technology. It's been working from day
4:01
one. Hydrate the power circle. Yes, taking the next level. I'm in all
4:07
of their programs. AI club, AI consulting, power circle mastermind.
4:12
It's something you can't miss. AI is the future. Networking has been the thing
4:18
that's important for all businesses. We're in a room. If you haven't joined
4:23
any of Alicia program, get in them now. changed
4:36
when I'm just one person. Being in this room as a newcomer, this gives me more insight into how I can
4:44
upscale even that part of my business as the ambulance guy. So now I can not only
4:49
see how I can upscale my business, but maybe teach you how to be a seven figure earner. aunt Thomas uh the little
4:56
sisters have been wonderful have been very inspiring. I'm so happy to be in
5:01
the room with all these great people who want to do AI consulting and work on the
5:09
next generation of being top in the world not just in their in their cities
5:16
but just in the world. This community has personally and professionally impacted me in so many different ways.
5:22
Not just changing my income, but changing my mindset, knowing what you can actually do with AI and getting ahead of the wave. All the different
5:29
opportunities that actually exist between like getting your productivity together, increasing your income. I'm
5:35
super grateful to be inside of the room. I know for a fact that this is the place that we need to be. A poet, creative storyteller,
5:41
professional problem solver. I already use AI in my life every day. Like it's my best friend. And I nickname
5:48
everything, right? Today gave me motivation to learn more, get more into it, go all in, be more open-minded about
5:55
how to not only use it for myself, but even more in my everyday life. This was my first time attending the AI fuel
6:02
profit events. Listen, my background is IT and cyber security. I've been in the military for 28 years. If you have not
6:09
gotten into anything AI, you are wrong. If you're looking to sca
6:15
scale businesses, catapult your life, catapult businesses connected to you, you need to get in AI like yesterday.
6:21
Okay, the time is now. All in for AI. I represent my own company by way of
6:27
inspiration from Alicia. My company is actually called Platinum AI Consulting
6:32
Agency. I find it electrifying because it keeps igniting different ideas of understanding how to transform better
6:40
ways of utilizing the technology with AI and it just makes you just excited. The more you think about it, the more money
6:46
you can earn. Just the different ideas and just knowing that AI is working for you. You're just prompting everything.
6:51
It makes you just super electrified. This is phenomenal. It has taken AI to a
6:57
totally different level. The things that you can do with AI just there's no words to describe it. what it has done for me,
7:03
it has changed my life and it has taken my business to a totally different level and this has been truly amazing. I have
7:13
been in it for over 24 years but this is pivotable. AI is changing my life. You
7:20
have got to make this a priority for you in your life because this right here
7:25
will get you to many different levels in your life. No matter where you are, no matter what you do, this will be a
7:32
gamecher for you. It has given me the tools that I need to be a seven figure
7:38
earner and I am not even in it. This is amazing. Alicia Little and her crew have
7:44
given me prompts, advice, and structure to reach my seven figures. You got to try it.
7:49
I am a serial entrepreneur. This event is powerful. It was so so so so much
7:55
information in gyms and tools that are needed for us as a people today to move
8:01
forward in a world that we now have access to. And all I can say get in the womb whenever there is an AI innovation
8:09
experience done by Alisa Little and Lorissa Little, get in the womb.
8:14
Proximity is what matters. And don't listen to the naysayers because the
8:20
naysayers will kill your dream. So get in the room and be a part of AI
8:27
innovation. Remove at the speed of AI. This is amazing. Amazing summit. And one
8:34
word to describe it would be lifechanging because it opened up doors that were closed I knew nothing about.
8:40
And learning everything AI, I feel like I have a personal assistant and a new career. Atlanta. It was the best
8:48
decision I have made ever. I am so excited. I'm so excited about the
8:53
teacher. Everything not only that I've learned here, all the goodies I got, but
8:59
the information that has empowered me to take it home changed the rest of my life. Alicia, thank you so much. Thanks
9:06
so much. An absolute amazing day. I'm glad I stayed. I'm very new to the consultant program.
9:12
you know, if I can't stop thinking about this consulting program, then I'm going to go in. I'm all in. There's no turning
9:20
back. And I just created my first offering just now. So, I'm in one
9:27
session. I've learned how to create their own GPT. I've learned how to create an agent and it worked. And also
9:34
last week we did something with the kids and my four years old and my seven years
9:40
old were able to create books that they brought to the school and they even gift to all the the people in the class. So
9:47
definitely recommend and also recommend to join the consultants. I feel that if
9:53
we follow the lead if we follow what we've been given the sky is the limit.
9:59
Amazing, amazing information. A great way to make tons of money. Honestly, listen, with AI, you can do it faster,
10:07
quicker, uh, better, deeper, it's so many different things. And let me tell you about the little sister. They
10:12
created a community where people help each other. Not only is it that they give us the good information, they give
10:18
us the timely information, and they do it in a way that brings community together. You want to learn from number
10:25
four, number five, number six, or you want to learn from number one or number two. and she's not number two. I learned
10:30
that today. So, listen. I don't know what it is you want to do, but you need to make it to whatever the little
10:36
sisters are doing because they're doing it in a way that you get what you need, they get what they need, and you're
10:42
equipped to give other people what they want. I have to admit, um, I had my doubts as to how much I would really get
10:49
out of it, but the truth of the matter is is every second of it was well worth it. The fact that we get to do it
10:55
handson with the tables here, follow along, put into practice, invaluable.
11:01
I've attended even other other trainings, but it was uh definitely
11:07
worth it to be able to be here. And the connections that I made with others in person, being able to exchange ideas and
11:13
implement them on the spot, that's incomparable. And I highly recommend it to anybody. Uh Alicia and Lorett,
11:20
they're the real deal. Don't miss out. But I'm super excited because the little sisters are getting me trained. I'm
11:26
going to be an AI consultant expert. They've already given me access to a gig
11:31
with NASA. So, I just want to spread the love that you can do it, too. And you can only do it with the little sisters
11:37
cuz they're the best in the business. So, I'm super excited. I met my sister in cyber here at AI Fuel Profit. So,
11:44
guess what we're going to do? We're going to expand our knowledge together. I am in IT and cyber security and I'm
11:51
expanding into AI and I'm looking to go and help all the people do all the
11:57
things. I uh just joined the power circle and um I'm ready to just take off in my business and help others. So also
12:04
the little sisters likeing amazing super super amazing like we love you.
12:10
And so I want to say thank you to Lorett and I want to say thank you to Alicia. And even though I talk a lot and I love
12:16
people and I know my purpose, Lorett, you are the introvert. You truly uh keep
12:22
this extrovert on his toes. But I want to say thank you uh for helping me regain confidence in myself as a coach
12:28
and as a consultant. And uh the community, oh my god, the community, man, you guys encourages me. So I want
12:34
to say thank you uh from the top and the bottom of my heart. So do never underestimate yourself and think you're
12:40
not until you finish. You are right now that consultant. You are an AI consultant and then Alicia is and
12:47
through the program when you finish you're going to be a certified consultant. So keep going, hang in there, breathe and keep dreaming and
12:55
keep going. To me, the two of them are the queens of AI. As a matter of fact, um I've
13:03
purchased a couple of courses to learn AI with other providers, but I actually
13:08
took Alysia's course. I've purchased others, but hers is the only one that I
13:14
actually took from beginning to end. To me, it says a lot about how she resonates with the information. She's
13:22
credible, and I love her facilitation style. I see a little of me in her and
13:28
so seeing her lead the way in this field makes the goal look attainable for me.
13:34
AI to me is brand new but I'm all in because of the support Alisia Little and
13:41
her sister Loretta Little as Branson. They are amazing. Do the jump y'all. I'm
13:47
doing it here. You can do it too. Let's do this together. They will guide you in
13:53
every step of the way. Do not be afraid. Alicia and R, they they've been a blessing to my family. It's like um I
14:00
just can't believe that this opportunity has came upon us. It's like something that you just got to jump into. Like I
14:05
urge everybody to like get into it as soon as possible. You know, this is an awesome opportunity and you got to really take yourself and like join us
14:12
right now. Drop everything and just join. Thank you. Right. Like 3 41 searching your name.
14:17
Whoever show you was on, I was on it. Right. And so faith in AI is my thing,
14:22
right? Church. Yeah. I'm a pastor, so I'm going crazy. Right. So, here it is.
14:28
I'm like, let me see if I can build a website for the church. On behalf of the power circle, we just
14:34
want to say thank you for lifting us higher. Thank you for believing in us. Thank you for reminding us that little
14:40
by little, or should I say little by little, greatness grows.
14:47
Okay. Alicia, she's the bomb, man. She knows
14:52
what she's talking about. AI is everything. AI is the future. AI is the now. Alicia Little's event, an icon when it
15:00
comes to AI. Trust me on this. She's not just a queen of AI. She owned this
15:05
space. It has been a mindblowing program. And anytime I get time with that group, I'm
15:11
going to learn something. I am a professor and children's book author. I already built my own agent. Her name is
15:17
Justice. She's a cute girly. She's going to be helping me with my social media. So, if you haven't checked out what
15:22
Alicia offers, do so ASAP. ASAP. ASAP. Me being a IT professional almost 20
15:28
years, she inspired me to learn more about AI. The way she presented it, the way I learned numeral things, AI is
15:34
probably going to be the best invention that we ever had in a long time. So, if you don't know what AI, you're going to be left behind. I'm here at the AI summit with my
15:41
business. It can be 10x due to the fact that operating on its own pretty much once you set that foundation. And that's
15:48
what Alicia has given us. I admire Alicia as the AI queen. I love AI. I
15:54
call AI a thought partner. I'm a marketing photographer and consultant and I see the value what AI
16:01
can do for individuals that that want to increase their productivity. Here today to support Alicia Little. She
16:06
is empowering us all in the AI industry. Super grateful and have the opportunity to talk about AI, learn about AI, and
16:14
it's really going to help grow my business 10 times because of Alicia. Everything that we do is going to be impacted by artificial intelligence. So,
16:20
I'm here today to learn how to prompt AI and do some great things to enhance my life, my work style, and my work life
16:26
balance. Felicia and the whole team, she is killing it in the AI space.
16:31
AI consultant and software engineer. I came out to the AI impact tour today to
16:37
level up my skills. Of course, I love technology. I came out to meet Alicia. It is
16:42
lifechanging being in the room with her. Anybody that get in this profession, it doesn't matter what industry, you can
16:48
10x your business quickly. I'm attending the uh impact tour here in Atlanta. I've learned so much.
16:55
Definitely a blessing. I found Alysia through the Earn Your Leisure podcast. Signed up for one of her free summits
17:01
and learned an amazing amount of information and ready to go. And I'm looking forward to the future in AI. I
17:07
met Alysia at the Women in Construction Engineering and Real Estate Conference.
17:12
And so I am so glad I found Alicia. She has been just phenomenal with trainings,
17:17
podcasts, and just all the things that she's doing with Neo. Uh I love her and
17:24
everything that she's doing. And so I have my own consultancy. And so I can't
17:29
wait for everything that she's doing. And I'm so glad that I was at that conference and I met Alicia. I found
17:34
Alicia on Instagram. When I found her on Instagram, I immediately went to the AI
17:40
field profits and have not stopped since. I joined the AI consultancy group. I'm just a couple of weeks away
17:45
from getting my certification and I am all in on AI. So I encourage you to do
17:50
so too. I met Alysia through Nemiah sport. I um actually you know joined
17:59

18:06
it's been a roller coaster ever since. I'm glad that I watched that uh podcast

18:17
opportunities so wide open and um I've already had some few projects in the
18:24
pipeline that I'm working on. I have a real estate background for over 20 years. I have a background trading

much for you. But if you learn how to do this yourself, you can actually go out and we're going to show you today how you can go out and help other people
28:56
with AI. That's our main premise today. We're going to help you learn how to implement AI into your life and
29:02
business. Then also how you can go show other people and implement it for other people as well to create an impact
29:08
income. You guys want to create an impact and an income, right? Let me know in the chat if you want to create an impact and an income. Just put yes in
29:14
the chat. So when Alicia gives you a play, I want you to do it scared. When
29:20
Gary Vee comes up to the stage and runs a play, I want you to do it scared. When when Russell Brunson comes up and shows
29:26
you a software or a tool or a platform, I just want you to go do it scared. Commit now and figure out the rest
29:31
later. I want you to commit now that you're going all in on AI. And listen, you don't have to have everything
29:37
figured out, Miss Porter. Miss Magnolia, you don't have to have everything figured out. I just want you
29:43
to jump in and take imperfect action. I want you to take imperfect action.
29:52
All right. So, listen today before Alicia Little. Are you guys excited to learn from Alisia Little? Let me know in
29:58
the chat if you're excited. Put a fire emoji in the chat if you're excited for Alicia to grace the stage real quick. So
30:04
before Alicia comes up on stage, I'm going to kind of give you an overview of how you can maximize this event, but
30:09
then also at the same time, I'm going to be talking about some giveaways and some cool things that you need to be aware of. Okay? Because you guys want some you
30:15
want to win some things, right? I think you all do. All right, cool. Miss Karen, you want to win some things? Mark, you
30:20
want to win? I see Rene is raising her hand. She's saying, "Yeah, let's win something. Let's go. Let's go." Okay, awesome. Cool. So before we get started,
30:26
I want to let you all know Miss Alisia will be taking the stage very soon, but
30:32
we have so many more speakers. So each day we're going to be going for quite a few hours. So I would recommend I told
30:38
the VIP and platinum this yesterday. I would recommend you just block out the next three days together all together.
30:45
Just block out morning till evening. We gonna spend a lot of time with each other. Especially if you're VIP and platinum. We have Gary Vee, Russell
30:53
Brunson, Myron Golden, Neil Patel, Adley, Coach K, Seven Buffins. We have
30:59
part of the EIL team here. Listen, it is crazy. Let me know in the chat which speaker you're looking forward to the
31:04
most, by the way. But we have so we have so much in store for you all. We have so much in store. So, I'm just letting you know now, you
31:10
want to block out every day, all day. Now, I do have a big surprise. VIP and
31:16
Platinum. Do you remember yesterday in the kickoff call how I told you we have a big announcement today? Well, I got
31:22
just hang with me in two or three minutes. I want to tell you all we got a big announcement, a big surprise for you all. So, hang tight. But listen, I do we
31:29
we are going to give away some things. Actually, let me know in the can you guys you guys want to win some Beats headphones? Let me know. You guys want
31:35
to win some Beats headphones? Anybody in here? Let me see what else we got. We got a an iPad we're going to be giving

31:46
win an iPad. I love it. And then we actually the team gave me this mystery box. This mystery box right here. It has
31:54
something inside of it. I can't say what it is, but there's something inside this box. Let me know what you think it is.
32:00
Let me know what you think's inside this box. We got a mystery box that we're going to be giving away at the end of
32:05
the day. All right. So, make sure you're staying to the very end because we do have some massive giveaways we're going
32:10
to be doing for those that are staying in the room. You're being engaged. But let me also say that Alicia has a free
32:16
guide she's going to give to everybody at the very end if you stay. It's a pocket guide to speaking AI. So, we know
32:22
a lot of you all maybe are newer to AI. Maybe some of you all just need to brush up on your AI glossery and like just the
32:29
terms of AI. So, she created an entire pocket guide that has all the AI terms inside of it. So, you're going to be you
32:35
anybody want that guide? I think that'd be super helpful. So, it's pretty detailed. We're going to be dropping at the very end for everybody as long as
32:40
you stay to the end. Okay. Now, all right, y'all. We're almost through it. I got a few more things and Miss Alisia is
32:46
gonna come up here. All right. The next thing I want to tell you is how many in here, you're tuning in with your family
32:52
and your friends. Just put me in the chat. If you have somebody watching with you and you're not tuning in alone, let me know real quick in the chat. Who's
32:58
got some family and friends that are tuning in with them right now? Let me know. Me. Katrina says, Eric says, "Me,
33:04
let's go. Let's go." Uh, Joseph says, "My family, let's go." Nicole, uh, Hyram says, "Husband and I, let's go."
33:10
Jasmine, my kids. Eric says, "I love it. I love it." So, this is we truly believe AI is for needs to be, you know, taught
33:16
at every age level. Um, you know, despite, you know, if you're young, old, doesn't matter where you're at. So, this
33:22
is what we want to encourage you to do right now. We want you to go invite a friend before Miss Alicia Little comes up here in two to three minutes. We want
33:29
you all to go ahead and invite a friend. All you have to do is send them to aibusiness.com.
33:34
That's easy. Can you guys all remember that? I think that's I think that's really easy to remember. AI businesssummit.com. That's all you have
33:39
to do. Go send it to them right now. If you if right now just copy and paste if
33:45

34:08
comment invited in the chat. All right, listen y'all. One of I heard
34:13
this recently. Somebody told me he says, "You don't go as far as your dream. You go as far as your team." So, I want you
34:18

37:45
Alisia. But this is what I want to say. Who you're about to learn from today, y'all,
37:51
in the AI space is one of the top AI educators in the world.
37:56
Alis, who in here is brand new to Alisia Little? Put brand new in the chat or who hears family? Put family if you've heard
38:02
Alicia Little speak before. Let me see who we got in the room. Brand new if you're brand new. Never heard of Alicia Little or family if you've heard Alicia
38:09
speak before. But okay, a lot of brand news. Wow. Well, who you're about to learn from today is one of the top AI
38:14
educators in the world. She's committed her the past couple
38:20
decades to learning marketing, sales, AI, and today she's here to give you that same exact information.
38:27
She's she's known as JP Morgan Chase's top 100 women to know in America. She's
38:33
been featured on some of the top news sources on Earn Your Leisure podcast. You'll see her everywhere. And I'm
38:39
excited because today you're learning from somebody that didn't just learn something on YouTube last week, but
38:45
somebody that's committed the past few years of her life to artificial intelligence and she's now teaching you.
38:51
So, I need everybody to stand up on your feet. I need everybody get ready. If you're VIP and platinum, I can see you.
38:57
I need everybody stand up on your feet. We need to get Alisia in this room with high energy, high intentionality. So,
39:03
let's everybody stand up. Let's clap it up, team. Let's play her video real quick. And let's welcome to the stage Miss Alicia Little. Let's go.
39:14
Trust me on this. She's not just the queen of AI. She owned this space. I am here with the amazing Alicia
39:21
Little, the queen of AI. Let me tell you, it is lifechanging being in the room with her.
39:27
She's helped everyday people turn side hustles into six figure brands. I can literally feel my blood pressure
39:33
lowering talking to Alisia Little, the queen of automation,
39:38
AI. The AI space needs excitement. They need demonstrations. They need energy.
39:43
Absolutely love it. Oh my god. I help people leverage AI and I demystify it. technology can help them
39:51
to make the biggest impact. The number one skill to have right now is AI literacy. AI isn't a trend. AI is
39:57
here. My heart right now is really to learn from Alicia, the queen of AI.
40:02
She gives you hands on tools. She gives you a hands-on experience. The way you explained it blew me away.
40:12
I believe that once you show them what they can actually do, they're like, "Oh, she did it. Oh, I can do that, too." It
40:18
literally took me like not even 10 minutes. One of the things that helps us to scale and to offer more value is to offer a
40:25
tool to our community. My mission right now is to just demystify it and allow people to see how AI benefits them.
40:31
Everybody out there that's watching this needs Alicia Lou. You just heard Alicia say we got to be fluent in it because it's happening now.
40:38
And now I want you to show up and leverage artificial intelligence to take everything to the next level.
40:44
We are AI consulting. All
40:49
right, everybody. Welcome to the stage. Let's clap it up. Let's give it up for Miss Alicia Little. Let's go.
40:59
Hey, everyone. Wow. Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome. I am so excited. Are
41:05
you ready for day one of the AI business summit? Say ready, ready in the chat. I
41:10
can see all of you. Welcome everybody that's here. I see all these beautiful people. Thanks for having your cameras
41:16
on. I see people from all over the world. Room number four. Shout out to my friend David Kavanagh who I've known for
41:23
over 22 years. He's here. A speaker um joining us from Thailand. I see you
41:28
David. Shout out to you Kimberly in room number four as well. Anna Kimberly in room number three. I see you Tina Long
41:35
in room number one. Uh and all these customer service people we have here. Thank you so much. Thank you everybody
41:41
for being here today. I'm so excited to be here. We're going to take a nice deep dive into AI over these next few days.
41:49
So, I'm excited for you to be here. Make sure that you're locked in, you're ready to go, and we're going to rock it. So,
41:56
are you ready? Yes. Yes. You're ready. All right. So, we've got a few things
42:02
that we're going to do today. If you've never been on a training with me before, I like to do live demonstrations with
42:09
you. So, you should be on your computer and don't worry, I'll be giving you
42:14
websites to go to and prompts to get. So, I will give you everything, but you
42:19
should be on your computer for the best experience possible. So, if you're on your phone and you can shift to your
42:25
computer, do that now because this is workshop style. So, anybody new, you've
42:30
never seen me present before or teach before, just type a new in the chat. I can see the chats. Just type new in the
42:37
chat. So like, okay, welcome Daniel, Fonda, Aaron, Tracy, Georgia, you bet,
42:44
Becky. All right, I see you. I see you. All right, Monica. So if you're new, we do
42:50
workshop style, which is interactive and doing things together. So that I really
42:56
believe that when we do it together, that's the best way to learn. So if you've been on one of our summits
43:02
before, do you like the workshop style? If you like it or love it, type love it in the chat so all the new people can
43:07
see how we do it workshop style. Yes, you love it. I love doing it that way.
43:13
So, um, and then we participate in the chat. So, if you make something, I will ask you to put it in the chat. I'll read
43:20
some of them out and then I ask you to celebrate each other. So, if somebody does something great, they post it in
43:25
the chat, give it a like or an emoji, and we're a community that celebrates each other. All right. I'm your AI coach
43:32
and trainer, Alicia Little, and let's kick it off. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. We're gonna start off today with
43:40
ChatGpt. So, if you have your ChatGpt account open, great. If you do not have an
43:46
account at ChatGpt, you can sign up for a free one at chatgpt.com.
43:51
Now, why are we um doing ChatGpt first today? Well, because most people have
43:57
ChatGpt. It's a very common tool to use and we will dive into some other tools today and in the next few days. I want
44:05
to just remind you of one thing at the very end. We have a pocket guide for you
44:11
to speaking AI. Michael announced this and what this pocket guide is is I actually get a lot of requests for
44:18
people to ask me to define certain things like what is vibe coding and can you give me an example? So a lot of the
44:24
terms that I'm talking about today and we talk about generally in artificial intelligence I've put together in this
44:31
guide. So it's my pocket guide to speaking AI. You will get it at the end
44:36
at the very end of the session. Just remind me and I'll drop the link for everyone. Everyone will get it at the
44:42
end of the session. One of the most important things about this pocket guide is that it takes you from I don't know
44:49
where your AI literacy level is right now, but it will automatically have you at a different AI literacy level. You
44:56
will know the common terms. There's even advanced terms in artificial intelligence. So, if you saw LinkedIn
45:04
put out a report that said the number one skill to have, does anybody know? Did you read that report? What was the
45:10
number one skill out of like the gazillion skills that there are in the world? What did LinkedIn say was the
45:16
number one skill to have? Do you remember? Yes. AI literacy. And AI literacy just means and AI fluency is
45:23
being fluent and understanding the terms um in artificial intelligence and how to
45:28
use the tools. So by the end of today's session, you will be so AI literate, so
45:34
AI fluent, but you'll grab this pocket guide. All right, good. Everybody say great in the chat. Yes. Is that good for
45:40
you? Is that great for you? So you'll get that at the very end. All right.
45:46
So now I would like for you to open up chatbt. So just open up chatbt and we're
45:52
going to start off by talking about the latest updates in chatbt. And actually let me ask you this with
46:00
chatbt. Tell me your knowledge level. like zero if you haven't used it before,
46:06
one if you feel like you know it a little, five if you feel like you're the best in the world. Tell me where you
46:12
rank as far as your knowledge of Chachi PT. This helps me when I'm teaching. Okay, we do have some zeros, ones,
46:18
threes. What? We have some fives. Those must be some of my AI consultants. You better be coming in at five. Uh we have
46:25
a seven on a scale of one to five. All right, I love you there. So, we have fours, fives, ones, twos, threes. Okay,
46:33
so just to get everybody on the same page because we are a community. Is it okay if I just run through really
46:38
quickly the settings and chatbt and what everybody needs to know so we're all together on the same page? Is that okay?
46:45
Just type okay in the chat if everybody's good with that. Or thumbs up. I can see you with your thumbs up.
46:51
Yep. All right. Good. Perfect. Perfect. Bridget, I saw your thumbs up. So, let's
46:57
do this. All right. We have our chatbt account open and um right now we're on
47:03
chatbt 5.2. So this is the latest model in chatbt. I am in a paid account. So I
47:10
will make a reference to what is paid and what is free with chat GPT. So you understand this because I know some of
47:16
you might be on a paid free some of you probably are even on plus and pro. Plus is uh $20 a month where pro is $200 a
47:25
month. And all most people really need is a plus account, the $20 a month. Now,
47:31
we're going to click right here on the Chat GPT. So, we're going to click on
47:36
ChatBT to open it up. So, you'll see your icon at the bottom left. And let me tell you this, if you have a paid
47:42
account and some of the things I'm showing you, you don't see, what you need to do is log out and log back in.
47:48
Because with ChatGpt's latest updates, sometimes to push it to you, you have to
47:53
log out and log back in. So if you don't see it, log out and log back in and then tell me if it works, just type works in
48:00
the chat, right? So we like to know that for other people. So the first thing that we'll do is we're going to go to
48:05
our settings in chatbt and we'll start. Let's start from the bottom up. We'll start at the bottom. And this is our
48:11
account here in chatbt. So if you click on manage now at the top
48:18
right, you this is where you can change your plans in chatbt. Plus $20 a month. Pro $200 a month. Most
48:26
of you will just get plus. If you are a business owner and have employees, if
48:31
you are a business owner and have employees, give me an E in the chat. I just want to see you for a minute. If
48:36
you have employees, contractors, staff members, give me an E in the chat and shout out to you. All right, so you will
48:44
want to get a ChatgPBT business account. The reasons you will want to get a business account in Chat GBT is it's
48:50
going to come with some security features in it defaulted that are set up for businesses. Also, you can build AI
48:58
agents, which we'll talk about later, but AI agents that you only share with your team. So you can build AIT members
49:05
that only your team can use and never gets to be available to the general public. Got it? All right. All my
49:12
business owners with employees say got it in the chat. If you've got that, you're going to go back and do that
49:17
later. Don't do it now, but definitely check that out. It's $25 a month per person and you have to have at least two
49:24
people to sign up for an account. If you are an enterprise, you have more than 150 people, you'll get ChatGpt
49:30
Enterprise. Chat GBT also has the government edition, the student edition, all that kind of stuff, the university
49:36
edition. Let's go back to settings. And then if you have kids and you want to
49:43
link them to your account, go to parental controls. And then we're going to go to chatgpt security. And when you
49:50
click on chat GPT security, one of the things that I want you to do is to turn
49:56
on multi-factor authentication. So, I'm just fixing something on my
50:02
account before I show that. Um, all right. Well, let me change that. But, all right. So, here with security,
50:10
um, you want to turn on multiffactor authentication on the au authenticator app. And what multifactor authentication
50:18
does is that it prevents or it works to prevent somebody
50:24
from getting into your chatbt account because you're going to be doing all this amazing things in your chatbt account. You want to prevent that from
50:30
happening. So turn on multiffactor authentication. What I do is I put the Google authenticator app on my phone and
50:37
that's the authenticator that I use. Do that after this session because it does take a few minutes. The next thing is
50:43
data controls. Do you see data controls? right here where it says improve the model for everyone. I want you to turn
50:50
this off. This says that the data that you're giving to chat GPT and what
50:55
you're putting into chat GBT can be used to train its models. And a lot of people have this fear of they don't want this
51:02
stuff they put into AI to be used to train its models and to be, you know, put up into the AI. So if you feel that
51:09
way, then turn it off. I have mine off. All right. And then the next thing that
51:15
I want to show you is we're going to skip those and come up to apps. Clip
51:21
skip orders, skip schedules for now. I'm going to come back to that and we're going to click on apps. Apps is what
51:27
allows chatbt to connect with different apps that you have. So these are some of
51:34
the things that my chatebt is connected with. One of the cool things that I did
51:39
the other day because I use ChatCBT as my assistant. And when I use ChateBT as
51:45
my assistant, I'm being more efficient. I'm saving time in my personal life and in my professional life. And we'll talk
51:51
about that more today. But I used it for Instacart. So I went to ChachiBT and I
51:56
said, "I need this and I need to make this. Could you give me all of the
52:01
ingredients to make this?" It gave me all the ingredients and then I said, "Could you order that on my Instacart?"
52:07
and it opened up the Instacart app, went shopping for me at Publix, put
52:12
everything in my cart, ordered it, and it showed up at my door. So, I didn't have to go through Instacart, search, ad
52:19
search. ChatGBT did all of the work for me. So, some of the use cases for adding it to Instacart or adding your Instacart
52:26
app, something like that. I use the travel part of it a lot, so the
52:32
connections with Expedia and that sort of thing a lot, my Gmail. So, just showing you that with apps and then
52:38
we're in personalization. I really wanted to show you this. So, inside of personalization,
52:45
ChachiBT has a base style and tone. So, let me ask you this. Have you ever
52:50
worked with ChachiBT and you're like, you're always too nice to me, Chachi BT, I want you to be a little bit more
52:57
candid or critical of me. Stop being so nice all the time. Anybody ever had that? Just put me in the chat if you've
53:03
ever felt like that. if you've ever felt like that. Yeah. Very too nice. So, this
53:09
changes everything. And this is new. This is new since the last boot camp. So, um, ChachiBT now has these base
53:16
style and tones that you can pick. I picked candid, direct, and encouraging, but you can change it to anyone you
53:23
want. If you want it to be critical and sarcastic, click on the cynical, nerdy, efficient. So, you have these base style
53:30
and tones. And this is how ChatGpt responds to you. Test it out. see what you like. Inside of the VIP folder, I
53:38
have two graphical images for you guys that will show you the style and tones
53:44
and when to use it and and sample prompt outputs that will really help you. So,
53:50
Carlo, can you confirm that you added those to the VIP folder for me? The the
53:56
two images with the personalization for Chat GBT. I just want to make sure.
54:02
Let's make sure that he did that. Um, all right. I'm sure he'll respond in a minute. And then, so you can look in in
54:09
the folder for that. And then it walks you through that right there so you understand which one to use. And then
54:14
here's some characteristics that you can add on top of that. So warm,
54:20
enthusiastic, like you can say, do you want it more more warm, which makes it friendlier or less warm. So mine is less
54:27
warm, but you know enthusiasm I love. So I'm like be more enthusiastic.
54:33
And then it even says like headers and list. Do you like clear formatted list or more paragraphs instead of list? So
54:39
you pick more or less emojis. I want less emojis, but you could pick this here. And then down here, this is your
54:46
custom instructions. And this is here my my unique style and tone. So I want
54:53
chatbt to always write as me in my style and tone. So whenever chatbt is writing
55:00
for something, it sounds like me and it's in my style and tone. The way to do that, and we can walk through this, but
55:06
the way to do that is to get writing samples of things that you've done. Put it into chatbt and tell chatbt, these
55:14
are my transcripts or these are articles that I've written or this is a book that I've written or these are emails that I've written. I would like for you to
55:20
define my style and tone. How do I talk? What are phrases I often use? And then
55:26
it will put it in a paragraph format. And you just copy and paste it and you put it right there. And now it's always
55:31
talking in your style and tone. So let me show you a quick example. If I open up ChatgPT real quick and I tell chat
55:38
GPT here, um, write an article
55:45
about living your best life. Chat GPT is going to go ahead and write
55:51
this article and it's going to sound like me because it's in my style and tone. So, it'll
55:57
usually start off like, "Hey, hey, and yep, see here it starts, hey, hey." And it's like, "Let's talk about living your
56:03
best life." Not the highlight reel version, the real one. The one you wake up every single day and actually enjoy
56:09
being in. So I talk in shorter sentences. This is my style and tone and not chat GBT style and tone. So when you
56:18
set that here in the these custom instructions, this is how you really can
56:24
maximize your style and tone and your voice. Um, Carlo, can you put my training for custom instructions in the
56:30
VIP folder for me, please, so they can review that later. All right, perfect. Let's keep going. So, now, uh, my
56:37
nickname, you just put your name, your occupation, where it says more about you, put your bio right here, your best
56:43
bio, and then this is the section that I couldn't wait to get to. And this is the memory section. This has gotten
56:49
significantly better with Chachi PT. So go into your personalization and let's
56:55
make sure that your memory is on. So if you're seeing blue right here and the buttons to the right, your memory is on.
57:02
Tell me in the chat, is your memory on here or off? Is it on or off? Most of you should have it on. And then I'm
57:11
going to ask you to do all of this on your computer. So if you're on your phone, you might not see all the
57:16
settings that we're talking about. All right. So everybody says their memory is on. All right. because we're going to
57:22
use this in the future in future trainings, right? We're going to use this in future trainings because the
57:28
more you work with chateBT, the more it knows about you and the more it knows about you, the more it can guide you and
57:35
work with you and you you'll be blown away by what you can do with this. So, we'll come back to that. And then chat
57:40
GPT has notifications. You can make sure your push notifications and email notifications are on or off. And then we
57:47
also have a general tab on chat GPT where it has the voice feature and we
57:54
will use this later. All right. So that's your walkthrough on chat GPT.
57:59
Everybody feel comfortable with it? Yes, you feel comfortable with it. Remember, I want you to commit to making sure that
58:07
you go back and you especially the settings, the security settings on multiffactor authentication and data
58:12
controls that you go back after the summit is over and you make sure that you have that set up properly. Everybody
58:19
committed to that? Say yes. Yes in the chat. Will do or committed? All right, I
58:24
see you. Travis, you said committed. Thank you so much for that. Perfect. All right. Now, inside of chatbt, there's a
58:30
few other things that I want to show you. The first is this plus sign right here. This is where you can add files,
58:36
create images. We're going to get into image creation in just a few minutes. It's been great. Shopping research agent
58:42
mode. This is how to turn chatbt into your virtual assistant. This is great as
58:47
well. And then there's some other things that you could do. Study and learn. We search canvas. Canvas is really good if
58:55
you're writing an ebook, let's say, and it doesn't write the whole ebook over.
59:00
it can just correct a section and you see it correcting a section. That's when you would work with something like
59:05
canvas. But these are some great things. Um the latest update in chatpt is chatpt
59:11
images. So we're going to have fun with that in just a minute. This button right here, when you click on this button,
59:16
this is the dictate button. And what this button does is it transcribes what you are saying. So it's your your button
59:24
that you can just speak to chatpt and it transcribes what you're saying. Game changer. And then this last button here
59:30
is what we call voice mode and this is where chat GBT can actually talk to us
59:36
and we can talk back. So this is conversational AI and we'll cover that probably at the end of the day or later
59:42
in the day today. So this is that's that advanced voice feature. So now you've been walk through chatpt. I will say
59:50
that there are two other things and I'm going to do a demonstration of one in a minute. But up at the top right you're
59:55
going to see this is the temporary chat. So, if you've ever done some work in
1:00:00
chat PT and you're like, I don't even want that to be saved in my sidebar, you can use temporary chat and it won't be
1:00:07
saved in chat PT's memory and it won't be used to train their models, which you already have that off, but sometimes we
1:00:14
just don't want things to be saved in our memory. Yes. And we don't want it to
1:00:20
appear in our history. So, that's when you use temporary chat. So, you can work in temporary chat just like you would
1:00:26
anything else. write an article about living your best life. Um, but whatever
1:00:34
is done in this chat, not saved in history, and then you're never going to see it again. So, here's the only
1:00:41
problem with this. If you love what you did here, and you're like, I want to go back to that later. Can't go back to it
1:00:46
later. It'll never remember what you did. So, you need to copy and paste this and put it in a Google doc or a Word doc
1:00:52
or something like that. Got it? Say, got it in the chat if that makes sense for everybody. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Got
1:00:57
it. Got it. You didn't know that. All right. Um I'm glad you learned something. So perfect. Yes. All right.
1:01:03
So that is temporary chat. And then um Oops. Let me get out of temporary
1:01:10
chat. And then the next thing that I want to show you. So I'm opening up a
1:01:15
new chat here is something called group chat. And so let's use the group chat
1:01:21
feature for just a minute. And so we're here at the AI Business Summit. So, I'm
1:01:26
going to use the group chat feature and say I want
1:01:32
um let's make it even better. So, I'm going to say act as a copywriter
1:01:40
and help me to write some amazing emails
1:01:46
for the AI business summit. And I'm going to call on some people in
1:01:53
group number one to join this group chat. The first 20 people
1:01:59
that respond, you'll see it in a minute. So I'm just um giving you advanced
1:02:05
notice. All right. So here we go. I'm going to take the AI business summit and what
1:02:14
chat GBT session am I working on? Right. So, I'm going to give it the URL for the AI business summit.
1:02:20
And then I'm going to say for the AI business summit,
1:02:27
um, make the emails emails compelling
1:02:33
and persuasive. Persuasive. So, oops. so that people
1:02:41
that read them know that read them are so excited to
1:02:49
join the summit. Um, and then we can put any special writing styles and we'll work on that in
1:02:55
just a minute as we go into email. I have a whole section that we're doing for marketing using AI for marketing.
1:03:00
But I just want to show you this really quickly. Um, write it as me,
1:03:07
Alisia Little, and let's go. All right. So, now it's
1:03:14
going to write emails for the business summit. All right. So, you see that it's written these emails here. Email two,
1:03:20
email three, email four. And so, I love it. And now it's like I can write some email um I can write some FAQ emails. We
1:03:29
can do countdown emails. In fact, uh we could add do some social media content
1:03:35
for me, write some tweets for me, write an article for LinkedIn, but I'm busy and I've got to go. This is the
1:03:41
scenario. I'm busy and I've got to go. So, I'm going to turn it over to 20 people in room number one who are going
1:03:47
to act as my team members. They're going to come into this group chat and ask Chad GPT to continue doing the work in
1:03:55
this group chat. This is a gamecher for business owners, entrepreneurs,
1:04:01
professionals who are like, "How can I work better with my team, with my peers?" Yep. All right. So, let me come
1:04:09
over here to group number one. And I pasted the link in the chat. Uh, let me
1:04:16
press go to group number one. Only the first 20 people will be able to do this.
1:04:21
I apologize about that in advance. I can see we have 12 in already.
1:04:28
Let me turn off that notification. 17 people in already. Um, all right,
1:04:33
perfect. So, look at everybody that's joined the group chat. Are you seeing this on your screen? Everybody who's joined the group chat. And so, now Mandy
1:04:41
has commented. Everybody's commenting. Hi. If you would ask ChatgBT now to do
1:04:47
something business related. So say could you write tweets please for me or ask
1:04:53
chatbt to actually do something. So all right look at everybody in here and
1:04:59
typing. So this what we're doing right here in group chats is I create the
1:05:05
group chat. I create the group chat and this is the message. This is what I want it to do. Right? I create the group
1:05:12
chat. Chatgpt responded and it wrote the emails. Everybody sees that. Right? it
1:05:17
wrote the emails and then now I'm saying I got to go. I'm busy but I need help in
1:05:23
finishing to write more content and to get this out there. So, let me add my team
1:05:29
members. So, here are my team members that popped in, right? I created the group chat. Remember, I I clicked on the
1:05:36
top right where it had the icon for a group chat. And now I'm turning this discussion into the best project
1:05:43
management space for a group out there. All right. So now
1:05:49
here we go. And so uh somebody asked ChatchBT, "Could you
1:05:54
write a LinkedIn post for me?" And ChateBT responded, "Yep, happy to." And
1:05:59
then it asked a question. Um and then, you know, the person will answer the
1:06:05
question and it will keep going. Could you write a social media post for tomorrow for me? So here it is.
1:06:10
Tomorrow's reminder. And um I think Cynthia Cynthia asked it to do that one.
1:06:16
It says, "AI is no longer coming someday. It's here and it's reshaping how we build, scale, and lead businesses." That's why I'm excited to
1:06:23
be part of the AI business summit, a space created for entrepreneurs, creators, and leaders who want to use AI
1:06:28
strategically, not just talk about it. And then it did that here. And then Catchy PT says it can do more. And
1:06:35
someone says, "Can you write a carousel post for workplace overwhelm?" And now look at Chachi PT
1:06:42
being such a good assistant and responding to all my team members, the 20 people in room number one who
1:06:48
volunteered to do this. And do you see everything that's happening right here? Yes. I love this. Comfort co said,
1:06:55
"Could you write one email that appeals to the special needs community?" So there we go. And we have all of this
1:07:03
writing happening here. All right. Somebody asked for could you create a compelling IG post ideas. It says the AI
1:07:10
wakeup call post. AI is not coming. It's already here. The question is are you ready? So it's giving the hook and the
1:07:18
angle. And so you keep working in this session to keep getting the content out. How many of you love this new update
1:07:24
from ChateBT? Would you use it? Let me see your hands. I can see all of you there. Hi Bishop Bonnie. How are you
1:07:33
in room number one? I see you. Um, and so, yep, everybody says you love it.
1:07:39
Okay, you love it. You love it. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Yes. Yes. Yes. So, yes, it does only hold 20 people in the
1:07:47
session. So, you have to keep that in mind. And yes, I'm just reading your questions. You could do something as
1:07:53
simple as um let's see, I am ordering pizza.
1:08:01
Uh, we'll ask for group number one to help me again. Ordering pizza
1:08:07
for my team. Um, I need your help. I am
1:08:14
going to invite the team members. They will tell you what they love as toppings
1:08:25
and then you tell me how many to order.
1:08:30
um and what toppings etc. uh let's say do you understand
1:08:41
and then I'll say there are about 20 team members.
1:08:46
Okay. So I'm reviewing this again. So if you missed it the first time look at the
1:08:52
top of my screen where it says add people. Do you see the top of my screen where it says add people? Just want to
1:08:59
make sure everybody sees that. Yes. So, it says add people at the top and that is what I have to click on in order to
1:09:06
make sure that you get added to it. So, hang on one second. This computer is
1:09:14
picking up my mouse. Yep. Um, all right. So,
1:09:20
pulling the mouse back over. There we go. Add people. And then I'm going to start the group chat right here. We
1:09:25
click start group chat and then I get this link to copy. Everybody's following this. Yes, this is the second time I'm
1:09:32
doing it just to make sure everybody is getting it. Paige, I see you in room five shaking your head. Thank you so
1:09:37
much. And then room one, I am pasting it in again. Okay,
1:09:44
if you don't see this feature and you are paying for uh an account with chat GPT, so you have to pay for your chat
1:09:51
GPT account, paid account, log out and log back in and then start a chat first
1:09:56
and then look at the top right for the group chat to invite people. It is rolling out to different people and
1:10:03
different areas. So, if you haven't seen it yet, check back in a little bit after you log out and log back in and it comes
1:10:08
in. So Tanette already said veggies with extra cheese. If everybody would comment
1:10:14
what type of toppings they would like on their pizza, then Chachi PT will help
1:10:19
me. I'll say, "Everybody has given you what they wanted. Can you now give me the order that I should place?" So what
1:10:26
does this do? This saves time. This makes me more efficient. I'm not going around saying, "Uh, Peggy, what what do
1:10:33
you want? Uh, Joelle, what do you want?" and trying to figure it out myself. We're using AI in so many different
1:10:39
areas of our life. Do you see how if you really, really, really, and I know that
1:10:44
you're going to do this, especially starting today, that if you really hone in on the different ways that you can use AI in your life, that everything can
1:10:51
change for you. What are we saving? We're saving time. We're being more efficient. Someone else tell me in the
1:10:57
chat what we've gone over so far today. Like, how does this impact you
1:11:02
personally, professionally, as business owners? give me some takeaways that I can read on the screen. Okay.
1:11:10
All right. So, look at Chachi BT while you guys are doing that with saying it's updating its notes. So, oh, it says
1:11:18
Alicia, we're ready to finalize. Okay, some of you are still commenting. So, chat GBT is is typing. What does this
1:11:26
feel like when you look at it? This feels like collaboration. So, we're now
1:11:32
using AI as a team member. Do you see how we're using it as a team member and collaborating with it? So,
1:11:39
ah, a really good question by Jim Ray. Jim says, "Will people get
1:11:45
notifications?" So, all of you in the group chat in in um that are in these group chats, you
1:11:51
are getting notifications that someone else is responding to the group chat. If you want to turn that off, go to
1:11:57
settings, notifications, and there's a place to turn off the notifications that
1:12:03
all these people are sending messages. All right, so you can turn off the notifications. I will also show you
1:12:08
where to find your group chats after you know you've started the chats, how you can go back to them later. Okay, so
1:12:14
let's see what pizza we're ordering for room number one. All right. It says, "We
1:12:20
need a personal deep dish pizza. One vegan, one gluten-free pizza, one full white pizza, multiple pepperoni
1:12:27
variants, a veggie pizza, supreme, light cheese, and no garlic." And then it
1:12:33
says, "Reply, finalize the order." And I'll immediately send you a clean, exact order list. So, I'm going to say,
1:12:40
"Finalize the order." And then I'll say I'll order
1:12:47
from Pizza Hut. Just FYI chat GPT. So ah
1:12:53
somebody says partnership. Um Dr. Kesha from room 3 says, "OMG, I'm
1:12:59
super happy I'm VIP. I already need to go back and rewatch so much learning and we just started." Thank you so much. I
1:13:05
love it looking at what you guys are saying. Sheresa said, "I can finally make money while I sleep." You can also
1:13:12
use it to uh your contacts from your CRM. That's right. So, if you didn't see
1:13:18
Debbie where group chat was, watch it on the recordings. And all of this has been captured for you to watch later,
1:13:25
especially well for those that are in VIP. And so, just pay attention to that VIP and platinum. So, Stacy says, "Does
1:13:32
Pizza Hut have vegan options?" See how she's chatting with it? And Catchy PT is going to answer her. But here is
1:13:38
ChatCBT. Headcount and assumptions 20 people. Mix of light and normal eaters.
1:13:43
Pizza Hut large is eight slices. Goal is that no there's no shortage but minimal leftovers. So order 10 large pizzas, one
1:13:51
personal deep dish pizza. And then a pepperoni personal deep dish uh
1:13:57
specialty must be right pizzas. So hey, there's even notes for Pizza Hut to
1:14:03
label it clearly. Vegan plus glut gluten-free. Label this Joelle. Do not
1:14:08
share. So I Joelle must have said that I do not want to share my pizza. So you
1:14:13
get one pizza all to yourself. All right, you got that one. So even the notes that you give Chachy Pizza, you'll
1:14:18
input it in here. And then here's the other pizzas that we're ordering right here. The labeling tips. I would never
1:14:24
have thought of this, but ask Pizza Hut to label the boxes like this. So thank you. And it says, "This will save you so
1:14:31
much chaos when distributing." So now Chachi BT is what
1:14:38
my thought partner, my assistant. Do you see how this could be gamechanging for you? So tell me in the chat, how would
1:14:46
you use this in your business, in your professional life, at home, with your
1:14:51
family? How would you use this? All right, so there's your final order for 20 people. I'm loving it. I'm loving it.
1:14:58
So let's go look here on the allows you to expand your business and and
1:15:03
marketing manuscript uh manuscript reads. Okay.
1:15:09
Um all right group projects real estate business project management asked as my
1:15:14
house manager. Okay perfect. So come down here on chatbt now and you will see
1:15:21
that there is on the left hand side of your screen there is something called
1:15:26
group chats now and that and you will see the your grouped chats right there
1:15:32
in chat GPT on the lefth hand side you'll also see new notifications from
1:15:37
group chat sometimes pop up on the right hand side so you'll see both of those. All right so here's my final count from
1:15:44
Pizza Hut. Give me a word that describes this. I would say efficient. It's allows save time. Time saving. There's two
1:15:51
words, but being efficient, timesaving, Latasha said, is just amazing. Okay. All
1:15:56
right. So, multitasking, thorough, and it allows you to do so many things. I
1:16:02
will also say multi- AI since someone brought that up. I was reading that on the chat. You can open multiple windows
1:16:10
at the top. So I can open another chat GBT window and have multiple chats open
1:16:16
at the same time or multiple things I'm working on with chat GBT open at the same time. Does that have help everybody
1:16:23
there? Yes. Right. We're good. Okay. So let's keep going. Do you want
1:16:29
some more? If you want some more, type more in the chat. If you want some more, type more. I will say that in the VIP
1:16:35
folder, and everybody should be VIP by now. Let me just remind you that with VIP, you get a copy of the recordings.
1:16:42
So, you will need these recordings and you can review everything that we went over today. And then I've so far asked
1:16:50
Carlo to put in the graphics that I have for you that talk about the
1:16:55
personalization of ChachiBT. And then also, Carlo, if you would add the training for people on how to do the
1:17:02
custom instructions so they can have their voice and their style and tone into chat GBT, which is such a game
1:17:08
changer. So, could somebody from support type in the uh into the chat if if
1:17:14
somebody needs to upgrade to VIP, how they can upgrade to VIP for me, please? So, yep. And then the VIP folder. I'll
1:17:23
remind you at the end of the day after I've added a bunch of things to it what's available in your VIP folder.
1:17:29
Okay. All right. Does anybody need help upgrading to VIP?
1:17:34
Just put help upgrade and the customer service will help you do that. So, and
1:17:39
then so much going on over the next few days. You want to make sure that you get these recordings. Also, after the main
1:17:46
session today, we will also have a session for VIP and for platinum. So, we'll have a hot seat session, pick a
1:17:52
few people to ask some questions. I have a special training on vibe coding. How
1:17:58
do you make your own tools? I'll be showcasing some of the tools me and my sister have made that have saved us tens
1:18:04
of thousands of dollars. And we'll show you how to make tools and that sort of
1:18:09
stuff, which I love. Vibe coding. I really believe that for so many of us creating tools the opportunity to create
1:18:15
tools will be such a great one for our wealth buildinging strategies for our business building. So all right so all
1:18:24
right perfect and it looks like the team is entering the link for you guys to
1:18:29
upgrade to VIP. So you should be able to get that upgrade if you need to upgrade. Yes. Everybody good now? Perfect.
1:18:37
Perfect. And I will just say do do me one favor and that is if you know you're
1:18:42
going to upgrade to VIP, please do it well before the VIP session at the end of the day because the people that do it
1:18:48
last minute then they have trouble like how do I get to the room and I'm already in the VIP room. We're already doing the
1:18:53
hot seats. So do it as quickly as possible. Okay. If you're already upgraded to VIP, just put VIP in the
1:18:59
chat so I can see you. Linda Davis, VIP room 4. Erica Blandon, VIP room 4.
1:19:06
Patrick, VIP, room three. I see you. I see you. Robert Wallace, room five, VIP.
1:19:12
I see you. Hello. Good. Good. All right. Ann room four. I see you. VIP. Okay.
1:19:18
Good. It looks like everybody's there and able to do that. Making sure that everybody does that. Okay. So, we've
1:19:27
done a lot with chatbt. Some of you are asking me to go over it again. Apologize. I can't just because I need
1:19:33
to keep going. But I do want you to go back through the, you know, make sure that you go back through the training
1:19:39
and then you can see it there. The next thing that I want to show you is with
1:19:44
chatpt. Um, this is how you open up your sidebar here, right? And if you go to like one
1:19:51
of the last chats you did, here's one called pizza order strategy. I can click
1:19:56
on this link right here and click pin chat. So now this is new. This is very,
1:20:03
very new. Now, chats that you want to go back to. See, I have chatting with Chelsea. And that's one chat that I have
1:20:11
right there that I pinned. It's a TV interview that's coming up. So, I need to to keep working with that. Me and
1:20:16
Chatty Chaty BT. And then a pizza order strategy. I have that pinned as well. Okay. So, we have those pinned. So,
1:20:24
those are your chats. We have something called group chats. Chatbt has something called projects. I'll open up a new
1:20:30
project here. You can create a project. So, if you're doing work for a client or
1:20:35
you're doing work for yourself and you want all of the information to be kept in one folder, I like to think of
1:20:41
projects like a file cabinet. So, you have a file cabinet, you open the file cabinet drawer and everything that's in
1:20:47
that drawer deals with this project. So, with this, I can put um let's say launch
1:20:54
plan. Let's do that. Launch plan. And then I'm going to click create project.
1:21:01
And then with that I can add files into this project here. So instructions like
1:21:07
how is chat GBT supposed to respond in this project. I can upload files. I can
1:21:12
set um a memory if I want to for this here. I just click on add to add files.
1:21:18
So this is how you can set up a project and work within that project. Now, anytime you type within your project,
1:21:26
like this launch plan project, new chat and launch plan, anytime I type in here, it's using the knowledge base of the
1:21:32
files and it's keeping everything in this folder. Remember, this is your file cabinet drawer. Everything is in here
1:21:39
and nice and organized for you. So, you don't have to look around and around for it. Got it? Yes, everybody got it. So,
1:21:47
um this is where you have your projects. So, let me go down to pizza order
1:21:54
strategy. We're going to click um here and then the pin. I just wanted
1:22:01
to see I just want to if I can share it in
1:22:07
here. Oh, nope. That's sharing it out. All right. Sorry about that. So, uh
1:22:13
somebody was asking about the add files feature here. Oh, the adding here. Anyway, yes, it open it adds files from
1:22:19
your computer. Okay, so anyway, let's keep going with chatbt. So, we have
1:22:25
projects, you have your group chats, and then at the top we have GPTs, which when
1:22:30
we talk about more about turning chatbt into our virtual assistant, we'll get into that, but now I want to have some
1:22:38
fun and we're going to use chatbt images. Have you seen the latest ChateBT
1:22:44
images? So it's chatebt.comim images. I do have a document. It's a
1:22:52
document that I'm going to paste information in throughout the days for you. So if the team could drop the URL
1:22:59
to that document in the chat. If you want to come on to that document, you can also click on the link for chatbt
1:23:06
images. I put it um in your document that's open to everyone and you can see
1:23:11
it here. All right. Perfect. Yes. So, Chatypptages. So, with ChachiPT images, we're going to
1:23:19
just try something fun, new, and then I'm going to show you what it's capable of. But I will tell you, and we talked
1:23:25
about this in VIP and Platinum a little bit yesterday, that it has improved dramatically. Right now, I'm going over
1:23:32
ChachiBeT's latest updates. I will tell you that the improvements have been dramatic. So, here we go. All right. So
1:23:40
now, Chachi BT has different things that you could do like try a style or an
1:23:46
image. So this is a great way to get started. Let's get started with something fun. And so let's do the
1:23:53
plushy. So click on plushy for me. Let me make sure that everybody's already here at chatbt.com/im
1:24:00
images. Okay. Click on plushy and then you'll either have to upload a photo of
1:24:07
yourself like click on choose a new photo or if you already have one here you can pick that photo. It will pull it
1:24:13
in. And what we see happening here is that chat GPT
1:24:18
all it did was it precreated the prompt for the plushy and it put the prompt right there for you. So here's the
1:24:25
prompt here for the plushy. All right. And so now it's going to turn me into a
1:24:32
plushie. All right. So now it's time for you to create your plushies. Let me do
1:24:37
that again. So we're going to go to chatgpt.com/im
1:24:42
images. And then you're you can click on whatever you want. Do whichever one you
1:24:48
want. For those following me, we're just doing something simple. We're doing a plushie. clicking a photo of yourself
1:24:55
and you're turning yourself into a plushie or whatever you want. So, all right.
1:25:03
Yes, this is this is the newest update with chatbt images. Okay, everybody's
1:25:09
good. Love it. Love it.
1:25:17
All right. Oh, I did it twice. Yes, because I was showing you. All right. So, there's my
1:25:22
cuddly plushie. So, did everybody create their plushy? We're not going to stop stop here.
1:25:29
Good. Did everybody get to create their plushy? All right. Yes. Yes.
1:25:37
It's creating. Hopefully, your plushy is cute. You're doing it.
1:25:42
Jocelyn, you love yours, right? Still rendering. Um, it's generating, working on it. I'm a good-looking plushy.
1:25:49
Paulino says, "I'm a good-looking plushy." I love that. All right, so now let's take this plushy to the next
1:25:55
level. Um, you could do different things like add your logo now to the plushies
1:26:02
shirt or change it to a sweater with your logo on the front. So, just upload
1:26:07
your logo or whatever you want it to say on the front. So, we're using some business use cases now, but I want you
1:26:14
to click on um add a photo and then I want you to add a photo of yourself. Let
1:26:21
me add a photo of myself here. I'll see if I can find the same photo. One second.
1:26:29
I'll just do a different photo. So, here's a different photo. And then I'm going to say, put the plushy
1:26:36
in her hands. She's holding the plushy
1:26:44
and pushing it out to the camera.
1:26:49
I want you to pick whatever you want. But now what I want you to do is to be holding your own plushy. So try that.
1:26:57
Oh, Allison says, "Love my plushy." Allison, that's that is so cute. Yours is so cute.
1:27:03
Uh Radaria, could you upload yours in the chat? I'd love to see yours. Latasha, oh my gosh. So cute. I love it.

1:27:32
good job with this. And uh some of you are putting designs on the t-shirt. So, good. Good. That's step number two. You
1:27:38
can ask it now to put a design on the t-shirt. And then now here's me holding my plushy and pushing it out to the
1:27:45
camera. So, here we go. Here we go. It's generating.
1:27:53
While it's doing that, I will show you an example here. Um, change the shirt to
1:28:00
a sweater and put these words on it.
1:28:08
AI business summit.
1:28:13
All right. And push go. So, we're changing one there. Um, so there we go.
1:28:19
There I'm holding up my plushy. So, could you try that now? So, hold your plushy. Upload your photo and hold your
1:28:25
plushy. Right. Everybody's got that doing it. Look at that. I love it. Gerald Trinity.
1:28:33
That's so cute. So, Paige, you said you did your daughter. I love that. Look at
1:28:39
these cute plushies coming out here. All right, perfect. Janet, Leanne.
1:28:45
Um, yes, great. These are great to do with kids. So, my consultants who are on here, if you're an AI consultant, this
1:28:51
is a great thing to do with um kids and adults alike and also for brands. So, just pay attention to this. Now, did you
1:28:59
see how easy that was to do? And I just want to reiterate some things that make Catchy BT images fun to work with. April
1:29:06
says, "Love it." Daryl, come on, Daryl. I love that one. Corey, that's amazing. So cute, Corey. I love it. Gerald, I
1:29:14
love it. I love it. So now, as you're looking at it and you're doing these
1:29:19
things, let's see. I think I right now my plushy has the AI Business Summit on
1:29:25
it. Do you see how now I can put this one on social media?
1:29:30
So to download it, you click your mouse over the plushy button and you're going to click download and it's going to
1:29:36
download on your computer. And to upload it to Zoom, you'll see like a little paper icon that you can upload to Zoom.
1:29:43
And then everybody sees that? Yep. Perfect. All right. Perfect that you see
1:29:49
that. And then now you can download it and put it anywhere you want. So, I am
1:29:56
going to go to LinkedIn and use this as a business use case for
1:30:01
myself. So, now that I'm here on LinkedIn, how many of you have LinkedIn accounts? Yes, you have a LinkedIn
1:30:07
account. You should be using LinkedIn for business. Yes. We're going to click create a post and we're going to put our
1:30:13
plushies in our business. So, put your plushy in your business sweater or you
1:30:18
hold your plushy and think of a business use case for it. So, watch what I do
1:30:23
though here. I'm going to use Chat GyPT to help me write my post for LinkedIn.
1:30:29
All right. So, now we're going to write marketing content, but I wanted to have the plushy done first. So, everybody sees I have the plushy here. It's about
1:30:35
to go on LinkedIn. It says AI Business Summit. We click next and then we have to write something. But now I'm at a
1:30:42
loss. I'm like, "Oh my gosh, what am I going to write?" So, I'm going to open up ChatePT. And guess what? I'm gonna
1:30:48
upload the same plushy image and I'm going to tell ChatePT
1:30:53
I um need a I need post copy
1:31:01
for LinkedIn. I am posting my plushy on LinkedIn
1:31:11
and the call to action is to make sure that people

1:31:54

1:32:07
altar ego the plushy version of me. Cute. Absolutely fun. 100% strategic.
1:32:12
You already know it. But hold up. This isn't about just being adorable. This little plushy is a reminder of what's possible when you actually play with AI
1:32:19
instead of overthinking it. Here's the bigger picture for you. It talks about that. Join us here. AI Business Summit.
1:32:26
And then it says, "I want to see your plushy. Here's how to do it." And it gives the instructions. Post it in the comments so I can see it. So, this is
1:32:33
perfect. Um, it says, "Let's think about this for a second. If you can turn yourself into a plushy in minutes.
1:32:40
Imagine what else you can build with AI once you actually learn how to use it strategically." I'll be in the comments
1:32:45
cheering you on. All right, perfect. So, I'm going to copy and paste this. I just want to show you like following it all
1:32:53
the way through for marketing. So I will recap this one in just a minute. Just want to make sure everybody sees it. So

1:48:11
Adura, welcome in, man. How's it going? How's it going? Yo yo, let's get started, brother. I'm passing it over to you. Okay.
1:48:17
Yes, we can hear you. What is going on AI Business Summit family? Uh my name is Adore Sonia. First
1:48:24
of all, thank you guys for having me on. Yo, how many of you guys realize this is absolutely the best time to be alive,
1:48:31
right? I'm going to give you some some little backdrop to that. Right. So, I'm about to turn 40 years old. 40 years old
1:48:38
this summer. Shout out to the 90s babies, by the way. Right. So, I'm about to turn 40 this summer. I want to give
1:48:44
you some quick context about me. I have no tech background. I don't know how to
1:48:49
code right now. My 10-year-old really needs to help me like set up the remote,
1:48:54
set up video games, all that kind of stuff. And I need you to be very aware for that so that you fully grasp what
1:49:01
I'm going to share with you guys in this next 10 to 15 minutes. Right? But real quick before we get rolling, let's do a
1:49:06
quick poll. How many of you guys give me a one in the chat? How many of you guys have your own business up and running
1:49:13
already? you got a business up and running already? Let me know in the chat.
1:49:19
And then two, how many of you guys you don't have a business, but you're like,
1:49:25
"Yo, I need to learn how to implement AI so that I could get paid by businesses."
1:49:31
If that's you, drop a two in the chat. I want to see who's in here. Right? So, let me know. Let me know. Let me know.
1:49:38
Okay. So, we got a nice mix of both. So guys, what I'm going to share with you
1:49:43
today is going to be equally important for both of you. If you've got a
1:49:48
business right now, pay close attention. And if you're just here where you just want to get paid by businesses to
1:49:55
implement AI, which is what I do, right? Then you really, really, really need to
1:50:00
pay attention, right? So I want to share with you with AI, I get paid to solve a
1:50:06
very, very, very important problem. And this problem is called speed to lead.
1:50:13
Put that down. Write that down in your notebook, in the chat, everything. This problem, solving this problem literally
1:50:20
has given me freedom over the past few years, right? So that's how important this is. So speed to lead, if you're not
1:50:26
familiar with the concept, you are familiar. You just might have never heard of the term. Has anybody in here,
1:50:33
right? You ever pick up the phone and you're like, "Yo, I got my money in my hand. I'm calling a business. I'm ready
1:50:40
to buy something from this business. Right? It could be a chicken spot, uh, a
1:50:45
massage spot, whatever the case may be. You picked up the phone and you're like, "Yo, I'm ready to buy something." Only
1:50:52
for them not to pick up. Give me a one in the chat if you've ever had that experience. Give me a one in the chat if
1:50:58
you've ever had that experience. So, what do you normally do when that happens, right? You likely call somebody
1:51:05
else. Like this happened to me recently. I don't know if any of you guys like I'm going to share something with you. Like
1:51:11
and my wife laughs about me uh laughs about me about this, but I love going to the spa. Like that's my happy place,
1:51:18
right? So I call up this spa. I'm ready to drop like 500 bucks on their top package. They do not pick up the phone.
1:51:26
Guess what I do? I just call the next spa and I paid over there. Right? So as
1:51:32
consumers, it's annoying. But guess what? for business owners. Yo, this is a
1:51:38
billion dollar problem. Whether you got small mom and pop businesses all the way
1:51:43
up to large Fortune 100 companies, right? If you Google speed to lead, this
1:51:50
is a big issue. Now, one, if you have a business already, you need to solve this
1:51:56
problem today. Type today in the chat if you got a business and you know you've been missing calls. You know you've been
1:52:03
fumbling on the phone right now. Then the other segment of you guys, you're like, "Yo, I don't have a business yet."
1:52:10
Pay attention also because you can actually get paid to solve this problem
1:52:15
for businesses. All right. So, let me Can I tell you guys how we solve the
1:52:20
problem? Type tell me in the chat. You want want me to tell you how we solve
1:52:26
this problem? type tell me in the chat. Okay. I mean, if you guys don't want it,
1:52:33
I you know, I could just go, you know, watch Netflix or something like that, you know? Let let me know.
1:52:38
Okay. All right. So, you know what? I'm going to do one better. Instead of telling
1:52:44
you, how about I show you how we solve this problem. So, one, how you can solve
1:52:50
this problem in your business, and then two, how you can get paid to solve it for other businesses. So, look, I'm
1:52:57
gonna make a I'm gonna make a quick phone call right now.
1:53:04
Let's see what happens. Thank you for calling Secure Future Life
1:53:09
Insurance. This is Lena, the virtual receptionist. How can I help you today?
1:53:14
Hey, uh, I saw an ad from you guys on Facebook about like life insurance policies or something like that.
1:53:24
Yeah, great. I'll take a few basics and connect you with a licensed advisor who
1:53:29
can walk you through your options to get started. May I have your full name? Uh, Mike Jones.
1:53:36
Thank you, Mike. What's the best phone number for followup? Uh 2123550023.
1:53:46
Yeah, got it. 212 3550023. Let me confirm that back. 2123550023.
1:53:55
Is that correct? Yes, that's correct. Do you have an email address you'd like
1:54:00
us to use? Uh mikejonesgmail.com. mikejonesgmail.com.
1:54:07
Got it. Are you currently interested in exploring life insurance options to protect your family?
1:54:13
Yes, I am. Great. Do you have a life insurance policy today?
1:54:18
Uh, no, I don't right now. Understood. I have a couple of quick
1:54:24
questions to make sure you're a good fit for our program. Have you been declined for life insurance in the last 3 years?
1:54:31
Uh, not that I'm aware of. Okay. Do you currently use any nicotine
1:54:37
or tobacco products? I mean, I I smoke a few, you know, Marlboro here and there, but not not
1:54:44
every day. Like, it's like every couple, you know, weeks or so, I, you know, I might hit a hit a couple sigs.
1:54:53
Thank you for sharing that, Mike. Based on our current program guidelines, we're not able to begin an application today.
1:54:59
I can send you a brief note that explains when it usually makes sense to try again. And if you'd like, set a
1:55:05
reminder to check back at a better time. Would that be helpful? Oh man, I gotta go, bro.
1:55:12
So, look, that was a live example right there of an AI agent uh that we actually
1:55:19
built for a life insurance company. Right now, here's the thing. One, did
1:55:24
you guys see how quickly it picked up the phone? And then two, I want someone
1:55:29
I'll give somebody a dollar in the chat. Why did it tell me that it could not
1:55:36
continue? So, I told you guys about this problem that we solve, which is speed to
1:55:41
lead, right? But there's another problem that we also solve for businesses. It
1:55:47
starts with a Q. It starts with a Q. Let me know in the chat if anybody knows
1:55:54
what that what that's called. Why did it hang up on me? or why did it tell me
1:55:59
that that that it could not go further? Yes, smoking.
1:56:04
But what that really is, it's called qualification, guys. Speed to lead plus
1:56:11
qualification can absolutely change your whole entire business. And guess what?
1:56:17
We're able to get AI to do that whole entire thing. Right? So, that AI agent
1:56:23
that I just showcased for you guys, one, if you're a business owner, let me drop
1:56:29
it in the chat. How much would you have to pay a human receptionist to sit by
1:56:35
the phone in your office in your business 6 to eight hours every day? How much would you have to pay that person?
1:56:42
I want my business owners to drop that in the chat. How much would you have to pay that
1:56:48
person? We're talking tens of thousands of dollars a year, right? So, for my
1:56:55
business owners where you are already fumbling calls, you know, you're not getting back to your leads quickly
1:57:01
enough, you absolutely need this, right? Two, for you guys that are you want to
1:57:06
get paid by businesses to do this, guess what? this life insurance company, they
1:57:12
pay me $1,000 every month just to basically rent that
1:57:18
AI agent from us, right? It picks up the phone 24/7. It's completely trained on everything
1:57:25
about the business, all of that. Now, remember what I told you guys earlier, right? I told you guys, yo, I'm not a
1:57:32
coder. I'm actually a two-time college dropout. I don't know how to code. I don't know
1:57:37
none of that. So, how does a 40-year-old twotime college dropout get paid a lot
1:57:44
of money by businesses to put these things together? So, I'mma show you here
1:57:49
on my screen. We're inside of chat GPT, which you guys are already familiar with, right? And this is for I like the
1:57:57
person that's sitting on this thing right now like, "Yo, this is too techy for me. Like, I can't do this." I'm
1:58:02
talking to you right now, right? So, we built a platform called GrowthHub 365, right?
1:58:11
That allows us to build these AI agents, guys, in less than an hour. Literally
1:58:19
less than an hour. That AI agent that you guys just heard pays me $1,000 every
1:58:25
month, but it took me roughly like a little under an hour to put together,
1:58:31
right? And I'm going to show you guys how we do that real quick. So, walk with me real quick, right? So, imagine that
1:58:37
we just got hired, right, by a let's say we just got hired by a real estate company, right? We would literally come
1:58:45
in our GPT here and I put in I've been hired to build a voice agent for a real
1:58:51
estate firm. They help renters in Philadelphia get apartments. The voice agent needs to greet users, get their
1:58:58
name, what kind of unit they're looking for. Uh what else do we want to put in there? Then
1:59:05
it needs to uh book an appointment
1:59:11
with one of our property specialists.
1:59:18
All right. So, we don't have much time here, but I'm going to show you guys this real quick.
1:59:24
Right. So, it starts here. We're going to build out the prompt for
1:59:29
our AI agent, right? And give me a one in the chat if you're still with me.
1:59:34
Give me a one in the chat if you're still with me. Boom. Look at this.
1:59:41
In a matter of seconds, guys, we've got the prompt for our AI agent.
1:59:51
Right. So, all I'mma do, guys. Yo, this is crazy by the way,
1:59:57
right? If you can copy and paste, you can do this for your business or you can do it for other businesses. So, now I'm
2:00:05
going to go into our software here. And this is something that we created here,
2:00:10
guys. It's called GrowthHub 365. Type that into the chat if you know,
2:00:17
put a little growth hub in a chat if you know that you need something like this in your business or you know for a fact
2:00:26
for those of you guys that don't have businesses. How many of you guys give me a one in the chat if you can think of a
2:00:31
business that you know right now that you would absolutely want to go sell this to? So look, we come into GrowthHub
2:00:39
and we literally guys, I'm going to go back real quick. I don't have much time, so I got to speed here. I just want to
2:00:45
give you guys a quick walk through, though. So, look, we set up our agent here inside of AI agents, right? So,
2:00:52
let's say we want to name our agent Rachel. Okay. What's the business name? TCS management. All right. Boom. And we
2:01:00
could literally come in here and we could select a voice that we want to
2:01:06
use, right? So, let's see. Uh, I like Dakota. The 90s were fun because it was
2:01:11
a time full of new trends, creativity, and all right. So, look, I'mma go with
2:01:17
Dakota, right? That's one of my favorite voices here. Uh, we have our initial message here. Boom. Then we go next,
2:01:27
guys. All we got to do now, right, I'mma switch to advanced mode. And what we're
2:01:33
going to do, guys, we're going to pop in our prompt.
2:01:39
Guys, as you're walking through this, I I just really want you to think, is there anyone that cannot do this? You
2:01:46
didn't see me type no code, no C++, JavaScript, Python, nothing like that.
2:01:53
If you can go into chat GPT to ask it for recipes and all types of random
2:01:58
stuff, you can do this, too. Right. So, we go in here and boom, we got our
2:02:03
prompt in here and we're just going to go next,
2:02:10
right? We're going to go next. And then look, I'm going to just go to
2:02:15
web call just so we can hear this real quick. Right? So, this is again, we
2:02:21
don't have much time, so we didn't like fine-tune this or nothing like that, but I just want to spark this idea in your
2:02:26
mind, guys. So if I go to start web call.
2:02:35
Hey, you have reached CCS management. How can I help you today? Hi. Uh I'm looking for uh a rental
2:02:43
property in uh in West Philadelphia. Got it. West Philadelphia. Great choice.
2:02:49
What kind of unit are you looking for? A studio, onebedroom, two-bedroom, or something else?
2:02:55
Um, I think I need like um h I think I need like a two twobedroom.
2:03:02
All right, a two-bedroom. Perfect. Do you have a monthly budget in mind for the rental?
2:03:08
Uh, I say no more than like $1,500.
2:03:13
Got it. Two-bedroom in West Philly with a budget of no more than $1,500.
2:03:19
When are you hoping to move in? Uh, in the next couple months.
2:03:25
All right. So, sometime in the next couple of months, plenty of time to find the right spot. I can set you up with a
2:03:32
property specialist to go over options and next steps. I have Thursday at 2. All right. So, look, I'mma cut it there,
2:03:38
right? I'mma cut it there. I don't have much time, guys. But do you see
2:03:45
do you see the power? Do you see what this can do for your
2:03:51
business? or do you see what this can do implementing this for other people's business? Right? So, look, imagine going
2:03:59
out right now and you call a real estate company, right? And they they're they're
2:04:05
terrible at picking up the phone. You're like, "Hey, I've got this AI agent that
2:04:10
we can install in your business. You don't have to hire any extra employees.
2:04:16
All you got to do is pay me X, right? Whatever that number is. Can you see the
2:04:22
power in that guys? Give me a one in the chat if you see how powerful this is either for your business or if you were
2:04:29
to implement it for other businesses. And guys, not only guys, this growth hub
2:04:35
platform that we built is crazy. Not only can you do this for like AI voice
2:04:40
receptionist, how many of you guys, you got businesses and you're promoting on like Instagram, people are DMing you,
2:04:48
but you don't respond to the DMs quickly enough. It can be installed in your
2:04:53
Instagram, Facebook page, text message. Guys, this is a complete game changer.
2:05:00
But look, I'm just I'm just a humble servant here, guys. I look I see some of
2:05:05
you guys asking how do you get access to this? I'm not sure guys. I'm just a part
2:05:10
of the team. But look, here's what I'mma suggest. I'm going give you a little suggestion before I hop off of here.
2:05:17
Alicia is like she's like super super super nice and she doesn't like to disappoint people. If you guys like spam
2:05:25
the chat with GrowthHub and you just keep spamming it, keep dropping it in
2:05:31
the chat. I don't know. I can't make any promises, guys. I I don't, you know, I don't want to get fired or nothing. I
2:05:36
can't make no promises, but I have a feeling that Alicia might maybe give you
2:05:42
guys access to this so you could use it. Again, I don't want to make no promises. I hope I'm not getting fired for this,
2:05:48
but that's her weakness. She's a really nice lady. So, if you know that you need
2:05:54
to get access to this, spam the chat with GrowthHub. One, if you need it for your business, two, if you know that you
2:06:01
want to sell this to other businesses. That's my time, guys. My name's Ador
2:06:06
Sonia. I hope this uh at the very least sparks something for you, whether you're a business owner or whether you want to
2:06:13
get paid to implement this for businesses. That's my time. I hope you guys didn't get get me fired here, but
2:06:20
uh I'm out of here and I will see you guys uh actually later tomorrow.
2:06:26
And thank you Adura. Everybody just put thank you Adura in the chat. Was that like I'm telling you all this AI information we're giving you this week.
2:06:33
It's all about expansion of the mind. It's all about expansion of the mind. Asking yourself, hey, how can we how can we accomplish more and make more with
2:06:40
AI? Y'all, I hope you saw how that could be implemented in your business. Does anybody see how that could be something
2:06:45
that you use in your business? Adura, man, you just went crazy on him, bro. You went crazy. I didn't know you were
2:06:51
going to show him a whole demo of it. That's crazy. So, I see. Absolutely. Vicki says, "Yes, let's go." So, listen.
2:06:57
Just remember, think a little bit differently for those of you all that maybe don't have a business yet. He just mentioned it. That could be something
2:07:04
that you offer to others. You go learn and master this skill. I truly believe AI is a skill. Everybody type skill in
2:07:11
the chat. This is truly a skill that you can go and learn yourself. And guess
2:07:16
what? You can go do it for other business owners. Because listen, I'm going to be honest, y'all. There's a lot of business owners out there. They don't
2:07:22
want to learn AI. They don't have the time to learn AI. They don't even have the tech skills to learn AI. So, you can
2:07:28
come in and you fill the gap. Does that make sense? Wave at me. VIP and platinum if that makes sense. Just wave at me.
2:07:34
Does that make sense, Melvin? Sheila, does that make sense? I see you. Okay, cool. Awesome. Amazing. So listen y'all,
2:07:39
that's the kind of information we're giving out all week. Marie, is that who
2:07:44
said that? They're afraid of AI. Yes, they are afraid. But this week, we're going to show y'all how you can get more equipped with AI. We have so many guest

2:11:12
personal use cases for it. How's everybody feeling? Give me one word to describe how you're feeling after
2:11:18

than never. I love what you did. Inspired, empowered, blessed, educated, motivated. And if you are not here uh on
2:11:32
screen and in the Zoom rooms, if you're watching this on YouTube or on social media, you need to get into these rooms
2:11:38
because I can see everybody and read the comments. So, how you do that is you upgrade to VIP. You're going to then get
2:11:45
access to be in the room and on the screen so that we can see you and see your
2:11:51
comment. So, make sure that you do that. Now, if my team would post that to everybody that's watching on social or
2:11:57
on YouTube so that they can get in the room with the VIP and platinum members
2:12:02
do that now. Make sure that you do that. You get the recordings to all of the sessions, all the prompts we're
2:12:08
dropping. And I have some special courses and guides to for the VIPs. So,
2:12:13
and then we have a special hot seat session and session after the main session for VIPs and platinum. So, make
2:12:18
sure that you are in the room. You want to make sure that you are in the room for that. All right. So, now let's go
2:12:27
ahead and talk about using we're going to first use Catchy BT as our agent to
2:12:34
do some business work. We're going to write some marketing copy for our business and then we're going to head on
2:12:40
over to a Google tool. So, here's my question for you. What is your business?
2:12:45
Do you have a business? What is your business? Type it into the chat. If you are excited to have a business in the
2:12:51
future or you work for a business and you're here representing that business, let us know as well. Let me know in the
2:12:58
chat. So, this is for the VIPs and platinum. Remember, if you're not in the VIP and platinum room, get in the room.
2:13:04
The upgrade is very reasonable. Do it and I will see you soon. All right. So, let's see. photography, marketing, life
2:13:12
coach, skin care, uh child care, tax professionals, licensed therapist,
2:13:18
utility company, um real estate, AI agency, okay, mortgage, hospitality, and
2:13:25
then I know that there are some of you on here that are excited to be entrepreneurs in the future or you're
2:13:31
you're starting that journey right now or you have your side hustle going. I'm excited for you as well. Tell us what
2:13:37
that is. And then if you're going to do something in the future, say future. You know, in the future, I'm going to do
2:13:43
this so that we can see your businesses. Bookw writer, author. Yep. Author. I love that. Consultant, financial loan
2:13:49
broker, dropshipper. I'm an AI consultant and trainer as most of you know, pastor, photographer, virtual, um,
2:13:58
visual bookw writer. Lots of different things that you all do. So, I want you to think about your business right now
2:14:04
and tell me some things that you haven't done in your business because maybe you
2:14:09
didn't have the team member to do that. So, I know that as I was growing and scaling my business, sometimes I didn't
2:14:15
always have the team members that I needed to be able to do things for me. Well, now we're in a time where AI can
2:14:22
do those things for us. So, think about the team member that you wish you had. Is it a copywriter? Is it a um a sales
2:14:29
coach? Is it a business coach? Is it a email writer? Like who is that person
2:14:35
that you wish that you had on your team that maybe you don't have the budget for right now? Even a virtual assistant or
2:14:40
an executive assistant. Maybe you don't have the 50 to90,000 US to pay someone
2:14:46
to do that. So a cold caller, you just saw that use case right there. We'll talk more about that today as well.
2:14:54
Social media content writer, that's a big one. Personal assistant. A lot of you are saying graphic designer, social
2:15:00
media helper, look at the chat. Those that are on VIP and platinum, if not in VIP and platinum, hurry up, get in the
2:15:06
room. So, those of you that are here, VIP and platinum, yep, I'm looking at all of your use cases and everything
2:15:12
that you're seeing here. Um, graphic designer, I love it. A lot of virtual assistants. A lot of you are saying you
2:15:18
need a virtual assistant. So, we'll talk about that in a minute. All right. I love this. So, this is what we think
2:15:24
about when it comes to AI. Now, I was asked a question in the chat that I want
2:15:30
to answer real quick, and that is why do I teach this? Why do why am I so
2:15:35
passionate about sharing this knowledge with everyone? And here's where my passion lies. 15 years ago, I went
2:15:42
through a very difficult divorce. And when I left my now ex-husband, he was
2:15:48
actually on vacation with another woman. I found out I made sure that I was not home when he came back. And I was at now
2:15:57
on my way out of there, I drove down to my sister's house. I went to a grocery
2:16:02
store to buy some groceries. And now in the business that I had with my ex-husband, we made millions of dollars,
2:16:08
had a very successful business, big bank accounts, money wasn't an issue. So I thought to myself, you know, I'm leaving
2:16:16
him. I'm out of here. We'll figure out the business, the financials later. Mistake number one. Anyway, I went to
2:16:21
the grocery store and on my way to my sister's house and to pay for the groceries, which had a lot of ice cream
2:16:27
in the cart, I gave the cashier my bank card to pay for them. And when she went to swipe the bank card, what do you
2:16:34
think happened? Yeah, it was declined. And I was like, "No, no, no, no. Plenty of money in the
2:16:39
account. Swipe it again." She swiped it again, declined. She looked at me. I
2:16:44
don't know if you've ever had you've ever went to buy something and your card
2:16:50
got declined and you're like, "Huh, not really sure why." So, I'm like, "One
2:16:55
more time, swipe." Plenty plenty of money. Swipe it one more time. She swiped it, declined again. My sister,
2:17:01
who was with me to save me from the embarrassment, pulled out her bank card and paid for the groceries. And it was
2:17:07
at that moment that I was like, "OMG." Right? So rushed to her house, got on my
2:17:13
laptop, logged in to my bank accounts. My bank accounts were clean. My I didn't
2:17:18
have access to my email. Like everything was just gone. He had completely wiped
2:17:24
me out. And he told me that if I didn't come back, I wouldn't get anything back. And he would make sure that my life was
2:17:31
miserable. He said some other words, but let's say it like that. And so now I'm at a point where my bank account is not
2:17:38
just cleared out, but I'm going negative. You know when your bank account, if you've ever had this happen,
2:17:44
it goes red and you start to see it like negative $50, negative $300.
2:17:50
And so I'm at a point where I'm at the lowest point in my life and I'm saying
2:17:57
and and you have you ever had this where you're like, why me? I didn't what did I do to deserve this? Why me? So, I'm
2:18:02
sitting there like that and I'm laying on my sister's couch. I get a call from my friend Les Brown and he calls me and
2:18:08
Les Brown, the motivational speaker, he's amazing. He's actually the one who gave me the advice months before. He's like, "You need to leave that man. He is
2:18:15
making you sick." Another story. So, I left. Les Brown said, "Alysia, get up.
2:18:22
Get up. Get up." Right? You know that that get up Les Brown voice. If you know Les Brown, you know that voice. And I
2:18:28
got up off of the sofa and I said, "You know what? My bank account is empty. I
2:18:34
don't have access to my email account." My sister had even created some courses and he logged into her courses. He had
2:18:41
all of our passwords. He logged into her courses and changed them all to have him as the owner and all of the the money
2:18:48
coming to him. She didn't even have our courses anymore. So, all of this. But there was one thing that he couldn't
2:18:53
take away from me. Do you know what that was? I had worked 10 years as an entrepreneur. This is my 26th year. By
2:18:59
the way, this month I'm celebrating 26 years as an entrepreneur. It's had its ups and downs, but I'm celebrating that.
2:19:05
So, the one thing that he couldn't take away from me was my knowledge. So, I sat for
2:19:11
a minute and I was like, I must have something that somebody else would be willing to pay me for. I must have
2:19:16
something. So, out of all of that time of being an entrepreneur, I was learning. And knowledge is something
2:19:24
that no matter what happens to you in life, you can always come back to your knowledge and use that knowledge to
2:19:30
rebuild. So my sister, she bought me a vacation in Jamaica at a resort and I
2:19:35
went to this resort. It was very nice. It was my like post divorce resort anyway that I went to. And I'm sitting
2:19:43
there and I'm the only person in this boutique resort. I'm the only customer at the resort. And I sit down with the
2:19:49
owner, his name is Mark. And I'm like, where is everybody? This is an amazing place. So he said, 'Well, we need to do
2:19:56
some marketing. We're having trouble getting people into the resort. So I said, Mark, if I can get people into
2:20:02
your resort, you don't have to pay me. Just pay me a percentage of the income that I generate, the revenue I generate
2:20:08
filling your resort, would you be willing to work with me? He said, "Yes, I need you." So my sister, I called her
2:20:14
on the phone. I was like, "We are about to rebuild. This divorce party is my rebuilding." So, I called Groupon and
2:20:22
Living Social. This is back in 2010, 2011. I called Groupon and Living Social
2:20:28
and I said, "I have this amazing resort. They need customers. Can we make a deal? It's in Jamaica." I sent them all the
2:20:34
pictures. They said yes. I put the resort on Groupon on Living Social. To
2:20:39
say that it sold out was an understatement. I used my marketing knowledge that I had built up from those
2:20:45
past 10 years of being an entrepreneur and we sold out that resort. And then Mark called his friends and said, "This
2:20:52
lady put this together for me in two weeks. We sold out. Groupon sent me my money. Living Social sent me my money."
2:20:58
And the another resort picked us up in Jamaica. We sold out that resort to hundreds of thousands of dollars
2:21:04
generated. Another resort called us. We said the one thing that going through
2:21:10
that divorce taught me was that knowledge and having knowledge is
2:21:16
something that I can always bank on. So I'm very passionate about teaching people and giving people that other
2:21:22
knowledge. That knowledge that will help them get through. I know we have a lot of overcomers here. If you're an
2:21:27
overcomer, just type overcomer in the chat. is giving people the knowledge that they need to make sure that no
2:21:33
matter what situation they are in, they can grow, build, and scale, right? And and now I know that the times that we're
2:21:39
in with AI, this knowledge is so powerful. Trust me, as somebody who's been here for 26 years, we had to build
2:21:46
websites by hard coding it. Wait till you see the VIP session. When I build a website by typing in a sentence, it's
2:21:53
going to blow your mind. We can build software tools. Back in the days used to cost tens of thousands of dollars. Now I
2:21:59
can build it by telling AI what I want. So knowledge and the knowledge that you
2:22:05
have here on AI is priceless. So let's dive in. All right. So I just wanted to share that with you and thank you for
2:22:12
whoever asked me that question. Um because it's really important that we all share with each other and that's why
2:22:18
we also have a community. You'll see as part of our community that we don't have a scarcely mind chat. We share with each
2:22:23
other. Let's pull each other up. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Okay. So now back at ChachiPT, we're going to turn
2:22:29
ChatCP into our agent. And let me just say one other thing. What I'm doing now, the
2:22:36
revenue we generate, the impact that we made is way better than anything I ever did with my ex-husband. So when you
2:22:44
really um focus on what you're good at and get in your zone. Yes. All right. So
2:22:50
we're going to click on this plus sign here. And I'm on Chat Gyt now. We're going to click on this plus sign here.
2:22:55
And I'm going to turn CatchyBT into my assistant by clicking on agent mode. Somebody type in the chat for me. Those
2:23:02
on YouTube, just type the word agent mode. I want everybody to make sure that we get this in. When when you're using
2:23:08
ChatCBT in agent mode, you're now using CacheBT as your assistant. It's called agent mode. So, click on that the plus
2:23:17
sign. And yes, this is you have to be paying at least $20 a month for this to kick in. So, this agent mode. So now I
2:23:24
just have to tell CacheBT to do something for me in agent mode. I want
2:23:30
to express to you what I'm showing you here is work that you can do not only for your business and for yourself, but
2:23:37
a great way to also earn income is to start a business if you don't already
2:23:42
have one or in your business doing this for other people. So what used to take
2:23:48
you a long time, let's say writing a LinkedIn bio for a client might have taken you a long time back then, but now
2:23:55
AI is going to do it for you, right? So you can do this work for yourself or for clients. How many of you, we call it an
2:24:02
agency. How many of you have an agency or would like to start an agency doing
2:24:07
business for other people? So you're going to do business for someone else. Um, yep. Okay. Quite a few of you are
2:24:14
saying just say agency in the chat. Um because there are businesses out there
2:24:20
that need you. They need you. So, yep. A lot of you are saying that. Okay. So in
2:24:26
as an agency owner, I want you just to know this that by
2:24:32
using artificial intelligence, you have an advantage to other agency owners by
2:24:38
you being now able to help your clients in ways that um are so amazing. So, make
2:24:46
sure that as an agency owner, you go allin with AI because now you can um be
2:24:52
more efficient, be more productive, and do more for your clients than ever before. So, I know that if you're going to start an agency, it's going to be
2:24:58
super successful. I'm excited for you. Okay. So, now here, what I'm going to do is I am going to ask ChatPT. Let me
2:25:06
start the process right here and then I'll explain it to you. I'm going to ask Chat GPT and I think I have put this
2:25:13
prompt right here. Yeah. Um, it should we you should be able to see it on this
2:25:20
sheet. I hope. Let me make sure it's public. Yes, it is. So, it says, "Transform my LinkedIn profile to stand
2:25:26
out as a top authority." So, here's what I'm having chat GPT do for me. So, act
2:25:32
as a top tier LinkedIn brand strategist. First of all, if you know this, tell me in the chat. How much would it cost me
2:25:39
to hire a top tier LinkedIn brand strategist to review my entire LinkedIn profile and to rewrite everything to
2:25:46
position me as a global authority in my industry? I mean, I want this LinkedIn
2:25:52
brand strategist to rewrite the headline, the about summary, the experience section. Um, just look and
2:25:59
give me suggestions for my banner, look at my featured content, review my skills and endorsements. Right? We need to get
2:26:06
more business. We want to make sure we're optimizing our LinkedIn, right? So, thousands, 2,000, 5,000,
2:26:15
Helen said. So, somewhere between two and $5,000. I just saved you between two
2:26:20
and $5,000 and a bunch of time by having ChatBt do this for you. Good. Thank you,
2:26:25
Helen. Okay, so now we're over here at ChateBT. And what I want to make sure
2:26:30
that you see that ChatCBT is doing is this is called agent mode. So you're
2:26:35
actually seeing chatpt do some research on what chatpt calls its desktop. Do you
2:26:42
see that on the screen? This is its desktop. It's researching me. It's looking at my different websites so that
2:26:49
it can craft a powerful LinkedIn profile for me. So when you see chat GPT do
2:26:55
this, you can actually see what it's doing and how it's planning everything and what it's doing right here. All
2:27:02
right. So, we'll let ChatGPT do that. And we're going to do some multi- AI tasking. Let's open up another window,
2:27:10
another chat GPT window, and turn on agent mode. Again, remember agent mode. Click the plus, click agent mode, and
2:27:17
then now I can ask ChatGpt to go to my LinkedIn profile and to respond to
2:27:24
comments. Um, let me see if where I put my LinkedIn URL. I was just looking for
2:27:31
it really quickly. Here we go. I can ask it to go look and respond to comments on
2:27:36
my LinkedIn profile as well. So, we're going to paste my LinkedIn profile right
2:27:42
there. And I'm going to say um look in let's do my newsfeed, my LinkedIn um
2:27:49
news feed and comment on five top
2:27:56
industry leaders. like think about who you would like to get your next business
2:28:02
from to get business from. So I'm going to say industry leaders in AEI.
2:28:08
Um and yep and comment D.
2:28:15
Um and let me read it and approve before
2:28:21
you comment. So we'll let chat PT do that.
2:28:26
Um and we're setting agent mode. So, we're thinking about chatebt as just being our assistant. What are some other
2:28:33
things that you'd like your assistant to do? I have chatbt then um really evaluate my inbox on LinkedIn as well.
2:28:40
Say go through my LinkedIn inbox, tell me the last 20 people that I need to respond to, organize what's in my
2:28:48
LinkedIn inbox. So, you're going to see that it's going to go navigate to LinkedIn and do that for me. All right.
2:28:54
So, I just wanted to show you that. So, let's see how the profile makeover is going. So, here's my profile makeover on
2:29:00
LinkedIn. And it's done this complete profile makeover for me. Told me what I
2:29:06
need to do um for my banner. There's the new background it wants me to use on my banner. Here's my about section now.
2:29:13
Optimize. Uh it rewrote my experience. And okay, I like that. So, it actually
2:29:20
went to LinkedIn. This is everything that I have in LinkedIn, but it's fixed it. It's changed it. It made it look
2:29:26
better. I don't even know that I have something on my featured section, but I now see everything there. Skills and
2:29:32
endorsements and all right, perfect. And then a recommended strategy for me, my content
2:29:38
plan. Does everybody see this here? And so what we saw chat GBT do is go through
2:29:44
all the stuff on the internet, review my LinkedIn profile, go to all these different pages to find information
2:29:50
about me and to revamp it for me while I was telling you my story. and off doing
2:29:55
something like that. All right, so now let's go back here to LinkedIn. So the
2:30:02
one thing that I liked like about it is that it will tell you and you can watch
2:30:07
it do different things. Do you see what it's doing right here? Like you can watch it as it's doing different things
2:30:14
and if it has problems even it tells you what problems it has. So it's still here
2:30:19
doing it. It says the LinkedIn feed is not loading. So, it's going to keep trying to to load the LinkedIn feed on
2:30:26
this one right here. But I want you to think about the different things that chat GPT can do for you in agent mode.
2:30:34
Click plus right here. Click agent mode and then describe a task that you want it to do for you. And now you're having
2:30:41
it do different things. Now, look at the bottom right here at what is suggested. And this is where you can get a start.
2:30:47
So, chatbt will say, uh, check Google calendar and book a date night for next
2:30:53
week. And so, um, I'd have to tell it where I was located, but it can go and
2:30:59
check my Google calendar. If I had it connected, which I don't have it connected right
2:31:04
now, I don't think so, but it will navigate to Google calendar. It will ask me to log into my Google calendar and
2:31:09
then it will go and do those things for me. All right. So, that is chatbt agents. Last thing that I want to show
2:31:15
you on chatbt because we're the next tool we're moving on to is so amazing
2:31:20
but this is chatbt scheduled tasks and I have taught this before but I am so
2:31:26
passionate about it because it's a gamecher for me. Chat GBT as your
2:31:31
assistant can do things for you send things to you for your business that will change the game. So let me give you
2:31:38
an example right here. So, we're going to go to chat GPT and we're going to ask it to do something for us as my
2:31:45
assistant. So, watch this. There's two things that you need to remember in schedule task. You have to give it a
2:31:51
date and you have to give it a time. Watch this. Every morning, somebody tell
2:31:57
me your industry. What would you like your assistant to send you in your email every morning? Tell me in the chat and
2:32:03
I'll use you as a use case. Right? So, it says, "Every morning at 6:15
2:32:12
a.m., send me a update on the for me it's the latest
2:32:20
AI news, right?" So, Antinet says, "Top AI headlines and news." We can do that.
2:32:27
Um, send me an update on the latest AI news. Start with
2:32:33
um open AI and make sure to include
2:32:38
Microsoft, you know, just giving some things here. Um give me at least
2:32:46
six updates and then watch this. And then turn those updates into a tick
2:32:54
script for my business,
2:32:59
right? And so now for my business, I can get on TikTok and I can have the latest AI update. So whatever your business is,
2:33:06
manufacturing, retail, insurance, there are a lot of people in here in insurance, you can do something like
2:33:12
that. Tic Tac script for my business. And then after that, oops, let me fix
2:33:20
this typo here. Include.
2:33:25
Okay. Um, and then turn it into a Tik Tok script for my business.
2:33:30
and have the call to action to DM me uh
2:33:37
to schedule a meeting or something like that. All right. So, the key here is
2:33:43
what? Every morning at 6:15 in the morning, while CatchBT works to do that,
2:33:50
let me show you. If you go to your chatbt and look at my screen, I'm at the
2:33:55
bottom left. I'm clicking on settings. Once you set up your first schedule, it's going to appear up here in
2:34:02
schedules. Okay? So, you're going to open schedules. You're going to click on manage. Do you want to see some of the
2:34:07
things that I have scheduled? Um, and then you're going to see your schedules
2:34:12
here on the right hand side. Now, I'm on a pro account, so mine looks a little
2:34:18
bit different than those of you that are on a plus account, $20 a month, but it's basically the same thing. So on the
2:34:24
right hand side here are some of my things that I'm getting back from
2:34:30
schedule task limitations. You can only do 10 schedule task at a time. Right?
2:34:35
But look here. Do I have any speakers here or future speakers? Tell me if you're a future speaker here. You use
2:34:41
speaking to promote your brand and your business. Say speaker in the chat or here so I can see you. Look at this. I
2:34:49
have a schedule task that sends me daily speaking opportunities every day in my
2:34:55
inbox. Daily speaking opportunities, right? Um, here's my daily AI news
2:35:00
update. This one, the New York City Daily Hot. Let me open that up for you.
2:35:06
I was interviewed on a New York City news station and after the interview
2:35:12
when it went off, the broadcaster asked me, she was like, "Could I do that and get like the 10 hottest things happening
2:35:19
in New York City every morning at like 5:30 a.m. into my inbox because I spend
2:35:25
a lot of time out there doing the research." I said, "As a matter of fact, you could. and then I can give it to you
2:35:30
in a script format where it's punchy and short and you can send it to the producers to put on the screen for you.
2:35:36
So she was so excited. So this is a use case for it right here. Search the 10 hottest things happening in New York
2:35:42
City today across Does that make sense to everybody? Yes. So there's a good use case for it. So to find that again
2:35:50
you're going to go here and then you're going to click on SK schedules settings schedules and then you're going
2:35:56
to click on manage. Yours will look a little bit different. I get weekly LinkedIn blog and content ideas. So for
2:36:03
your business, here's another idea. I have partnership opportunities. Look at this one. Search for five potential
2:36:10
partnership or collaboration opportunities for my business. And then it talks about who I am. You talk about
2:36:15
who you are. Do you guys want this prompt? Do you want me to put this on the I can put this on the document for
2:36:21
you, the notion doc. Do you want this prompt if you want it? Let me check the chat to see if anyone wants. Okay, you do want it. So, search for five
2:36:28
potential partnership or collaboration opportunities for my business. I'm an AI certified consultant who trains and
2:36:33
speaks on AI. Include the company or influencer's name, why the partnership makes strategic sense. I need to know
2:36:38
that. What value we could offer them, a suggested approach, um examples of successful similar partnerships, and
2:36:45
then send me the results. So, every Monday at 2 a.m., so this is weekly. Every Monday at 2 a.m. I get that in my
2:36:53
inbox. Is that good? Yes. Is that good? So, I will put this on this notion document that everybody will get. It's
2:37:00
just an open document. I put the prompt at the bottom. Search for five potential. I think that's a good one.
2:37:05
Did you see any others that I did that you would like? Let me go back and see
2:37:11
where where was I? Oh, so you can pause a schedule task, you can delete it, you
2:37:18
can also edit the schedule task and then have a conversation with Chat GPT every time it sends you a schedule task. So,
2:37:25
is that good for everybody? Yep. You kind of see the use cases for this. I think for businesses, this is the agents
2:37:32
and the schedule task and the group chat are some of the biggest takeaways that
2:37:38
when you're using chat GPT for business, you'll see the amazing stuff that it can
2:37:43
happen. Um, I was doing this for a tax professional. Send daily tax code and
2:37:48
IRS updates. Any tax professionals here? I did this for a real estate agent. Send
2:37:54
daily home search for Jasmine in in area code 30331. So anybody here in real estate? I can
2:38:01
show this if we have some real estate people here. Say re if you're in real estate. So I know platinum. Okay, we do
2:38:09
have real estate. Perfect. So look at this one here. It says and tell me if you want me to give you this prompt as
2:38:15
well, but it says search for new or updated homes for sale in this zip code that have and here's everything Jasmine
2:38:21
wants. So, it has these things in it that Jasmine wants. And so, I will Yes, you want this one. I'll copy and paste
2:38:27
this one for you in the notion doc as well. How much time will that save you
2:38:32
agents if you're getting all the updates in your email box? But the best thing about this
2:38:40
is that you can also tell it to write an email to her. So, watch this. Here's
2:38:45
where I say right here, um, highlight homes, da da da, search for updates. And
2:38:52
then it says, then write a short, friendly daily summary email for Jasmine that includes the top three listings.
2:38:58
Um, a closing invite to her. It starts off with, "Hey, Jasmine, here's what just hit the market today, saving you
2:39:05
loads of time, right? Loads of time."
2:39:10
Um, and so, uh, Tisha, tell me about your business.
2:39:16
Tell me in the chat what business you have. So, saving you loads of time. So, whatever business you have, think about the use case for scheduled task as you
2:39:23
do that as well. All right. So, um, Lorett, if you have the link for this
2:39:29
notion doc that you set up just so people can get all the prompts, that would be amazing and you can drop that
2:39:35
in the chat. So for an event decorating business, I don't know, you can ask how
2:39:41
do you find clients? So you think about how you find clients and you ask where are these people? What events can you go
2:39:47
to? It'll send you the daily events that are happening in your city so you can get to know different people. All those
2:39:53
things that would take you a lot of time. You can do that with schedule task. So somebody give me a use case for
2:39:58
schedule task that you're about to set up. Tell me in the chat. I want to see what you're about to set up for schedule
2:40:05
task. Oh, and I have created a document. Carlo, are you there? I have created a
2:40:12
document. Schedule task for business. Um, I am going to I know that you're
2:40:19
going to put that in the VIP room. So, let me just look for it really quickly.
2:40:24
Carlos, send it to me on WhatsApp so I can show everybody. But for business owners, I have a document for you in the
2:40:34
VIP that gives you all these different use cases that you can use scheduled task for. Ah, here it is. The business
2:40:41
owner's guide to scheduled tasks. Okay,
2:40:46
let me put it over here on this screen really quickly. So, this is just um my
2:40:53
document for you on a bunch of different ways for opportunity and lead monitoring, partnership opportunities.
2:41:00
We went over that one. Content and marketing, professional growth, skill building, business strategy. So, it's
2:41:05
just different ways that business owners can use schedule task and that is in your VIP folder or Carlo will drop it in
2:41:12
there in a few minutes so that you all have that and you can go through that and there's different samples in there
2:41:18
that you can use. Is that good? Yes. All right. He'll put that in there. I just told him to put that in there. So, you
2:41:23
you guys will get that in there and maybe at the end of my session today, I'll make sure that I drop all those documents in there for you. I just did
2:41:30
that one last night. I'm like, they need to know all these different ways that they can use it. So, I was showing you my use cases, just being transparent and
2:41:37
showing you some of my use cases. I hope that that helped. Okay. All right. Perfect. Let me show you one last thing
2:41:44
here. We're going to go back to agent mode. And right here, chatbt says it's
2:41:50
navigated to Google calendar and it's asking for your login. So, I have to log into Google calendar. Another way to do
2:41:57
this is to click on go back to your settings, click on settings, and then click on apps and inside of apps, I can
2:42:05
add my Google calendar. So, I can enable my Google calendar. And look at how many
2:42:11
apps are in here. You go to featured lifestyle. And for a lot of us business owners, we're going to go into the
2:42:18
productivity tab. And I can see here that I can connect my Gmail and my Google calendar will be connected. And
2:42:25
then now it opens up that whole world. I'm going to show you how to do some of this on Gemini as well. All right. So we
2:42:32
are going to leave Catchy PT and go to a tool that's going to change everything for you and it is notebook LM. for this
2:42:39
interactive um exercise. Lorett, could you make sure everybody has the notion
2:42:45
document and if you want to unmute yourself to talk to me, that is awesome as well because I am about to show
2:42:52
everybody how to use this amazing tool called Notebook LM. We're going to do a live demonstration and you can do it
2:42:59
along with us. So, let me go ahead and copy these into this. These are just
2:43:05
YouTube links. Don't do anything with them yet. All right, just those YouTube links I'm putting there at the bottom.
2:43:10
But now let's go to this tool called notebookm.google.com.
2:43:17
notebooklm.google.com notebooklm.google.com.
2:43:25
Melanie said, "I need three screens for this. I was not ready." I know. Melanie,
2:43:31

2:43:36
this tool. So, when you I'll tell you what Notebook LM is in a minute or why you should care, but when you get to
2:43:42
Notebook LM, click on create new notebook and then just stay right here for a minute. This tool right here is
2:43:50
about to change the way that you learn, the way that you deliver content to your
2:43:55
clients, the way that you maximize your learning.
2:44:01
So, if you haven't used Notebook LM yet, welcome to this amazing tool. Notebook LM is a Google tool. So, you'll have to
2:44:10
have a Gmail account to make sure that you can use Notebook LM. So, is everybody at Notebook LM now?
2:44:16
Notebookm.google. Yep. Okay, perfect. Richard said you have three screens growing right now,
2:44:22
Richard, to get all this work done. All right, good, good, good, good.
2:44:27
Now on notebook LM we're going to do an activity together and then I'm going to get from you. So start to think about it
2:44:35
now use cases for your business. You're going to tell me in the chat so we can tell everybody else how you would use this in your business. But um let me use
2:44:43
a use case for myself. Okay. So I've done quite a few podcast with my great
2:44:48
friend Nehemiah Davis. The podcasts were awesome. People love them. But what people keep asking me for is could you
2:44:54
take all those podcasts and give me an ebook, a document, a like I really want
2:44:59
to deep dive into the learning from those podcasts. So this is what I'm going to give to my customers. Everybody
2:45:05
got it? So how do I do that? I could take all these YouTube links which are
2:45:11
right here on that document. Okay, here's all these YouTube links. Get the
2:45:17
transcripts. You know the manual way to do it. Who would do that? Too much work. But
2:45:24
the AI way to do this is to click on Notebook LM and then you can search the web for new sources. You see that at the
2:45:30
top. But you see where it says or drop your files there. You can upload files, use files from your Google Drive, copy
2:45:36
and paste. But I'm going to click on the YouTube part of it. And then I'm just going to paste these links in. And I'm
2:45:42
inviting everybody. I gave you the YouTube links so that we can all do this activity together because I know once I
2:45:47
do it once with you, you're off and running to the races. Good. Everybody good with that? Okay. So, Notebook LM,
2:45:55
you should be at Taylor. I love it. Wayne has three A lot of you have three screens open right now. I love that. Or
2:46:02
three computer screens up. So, I need pictures of some of these. Take a picture and send it to me in LinkedIn. I
2:46:07
want to see your three screens. those of you that chimed in and said that you have multiple screens with all of this
2:46:13
happening right now. So, all of the URLs are in. So, let's review that. Everybody
2:46:18
went to Notebook LM. You clicked on create new notebook. You clicked on the YouTube icon. You pasted in the YouTube.
2:46:24
And then now you're going to click on insert. Okay. And then you see now you
2:46:30
see all of the YouTube links in there. They're all propagating in your notebook. LM. You should see it. and
2:46:36
they start to give you a check mark once all of the YouTube videos are in there.
2:46:42
Let's see. I have an error on two videos, but that's okay. I have enough in there. Okay, so now that I have all
2:46:48
of the videos in here, I'm not sure why I have an error on these two videos. It could be a problem that I have, but let
2:46:54
let me go back. Where are the YouTube links? So, the document if the document that the team dropped in the chat for
2:47:01
you, um at the very bottom, scroll to the bottom. Do you see these YouTube links? Someone tell me if you see these
2:47:08
YouTube links on this notion document. The business summit day one. Yes. Okay.
2:47:14
So, the business summit day one. You see this them at the bottom. So, this is the document that I'm pasting things on for
2:47:20
you today. I just want you to scroll to the bottom. So, if you don't see it,
2:47:25
click the refresh button to reload the page. Okay. So, Trinity, thanks for
2:47:31
telling people to do that. And Simone says refresh. Okay, everybody said it. It it it it worked for them now. Okay,
2:47:37
perfect. So, now you're at notebook LM. You put these sources in here. Perfect.
2:47:42
On these sources. Um, all right. So, if you get a read on two of them, it's cuz
2:47:50
for some reason the transcript can't be imported, but that's okay. So, I put in videos here, and then look, it gives you
2:47:56
a summary right in the middle of this right here. Do you see the summary of what this is right here? In these
2:48:02
discussions, Alicia Little uh explains how entrepreneurs can use artificial
2:48:08
intelligence to um and then you know I would definitely
2:48:13
want to change the the title here of that. So it made up this title itself.
2:48:19
So I can tell it to change this title. So I'm going to say change that title.
2:48:25
Uh it's 2026, you know. So we can do things like that and it'll change the title. But that's like kind of the
2:48:31
overview that it's giving us here. Now, watch what we're going to do here. Look
2:48:37
at the the right hand side. And I just want you to click every button. On your
2:48:44
marks, get set, go. Click audio overview, click video overview, click
2:48:49
mind map, click on reports, and then pick one of these. Briefing doc, study guide, blog post. I like the studying
2:48:56
guide and the briefing doc. Click on flashcards. Click on quiz. Click on
2:49:01
infographic. Click on slide deck. Click on data table. All right. And then look
2:49:07
at it at the bottom. It says that it's generating, right? All right. Flashcards
2:49:13
isn't working. So go back to try flashcards one more time. So you can see that it's generating down
2:49:19
here. The mind map is already done. Everybody sees that the mind map is already done. Wanting to make sure that
2:49:25
everybody catches up with me. Everybody's catching up with me. Yes.
2:49:31
Yes. Um, Condra says, "As VIPs, do we get a recording of all this?" Yes, you get a recording of all of this. So,
2:49:37
don't worry, you will get a recording of all of this. Perfect. Okay. And perfect.
2:49:44
All right. Notebook. So, while we're waiting for this, it's still generating the slide deck, generating the
2:49:50
infographic. Okay. The data table is new. Um, so if
2:49:57
you don't see that in your account, you might have to log out and log back in. Or maybe that's only available on the
2:50:03
the paid account. So,
2:50:08
all right. So, okay. I will I will review the steps again, but you're going to watch this again on the recording.
2:50:13
I'm using YouTube links. I wanted to give you the YouTube links just to make it easy for you, but you could put any
2:50:20
type of content you want in there. So, think about the use cases for your business. So for your business, let's
2:50:26
say you just created documents for your customers, but your customers need
2:50:31
different ways that they can consume your information. So what if just by
2:50:36
uploading your documents to a tool, you could get a video, you could get an infographic, you could get a slide deck,
2:50:43
you could get a mind map of your business content. Maybe it's the ebook that you wrote. Maybe it's the course
2:50:50
content that you created. Maybe it's the instruction manuals. Nobody reads your
2:50:55
instruction manuals, but what if you could change the format of those instruction manuals into another type of
2:51:01
way that people consume content, right? So, do we have any teachers in the room? How many of you know that people like to
2:51:08
consume content in different ways? We have readers. We have people who prefer audio to listen to audio to videos. Yes.
2:51:15
Give me a yes if you're a teacher and you know that in there. Um, Chennet said, "Wow, this just saved me thousands
2:51:22
of dollars in time." So, I'm guessing she already clicked on everything. Am I right, Chen? And then you can also ask
2:51:28
it questions in the chat, right? So, in the chat in the middle, you can ask it
2:51:33
questions. You can ask it to create something for you. So I can say create a
2:51:40
blog post um from this content
2:51:45
content uh the blog post will be on my blog Alicia little
2:51:56
what time resources
2:52:01
the what this saves you. Are you ready to review some of the things that it created? Now, if you're doing this with
2:52:06
us, tell me in the chat what this is like for you. If you've already gotten something, you've already clicked on it,
2:52:12
give me your feedback. All right. And then I love it. I love it. Yes. Yes. The
2:52:17
Vanessa said, "It's wild." Latasha says, "As a podcaster, my mind is blown." Yes.
2:52:23
Great tool for podcasters. So, and we'll be covering some other things for
2:52:28
podcasters, those of you who have one and don't have one, in the next few days. So, stay tuned. And I've got some
2:52:34
very cool things. I'm going to show you live how to launch one with AI. Okay. So, while some things are still
2:52:40
generating, let's look at what's already done. So, you can still see that it's generating the audio overview. So, let's
2:52:47
look at the guide. So, look at this infographic that it created.
2:52:53
AI for entrepreneurs, your guide to six and seven figure opportunities. Offer high demand AI services. Become an AI
2:53:00
consultant. The number two most in- demand job. LinkedIn ranks AI consultants as a top job with pay
2:53:05
ranging from 5,000 to $15,000 per hour. Like, this was content that was recorded
2:53:12
on all of these YouTube videos put together as this beautiful infographic.
2:53:18
Do you like that? Is does that one look good? Did you create one for yourselves? Did you create one? How does it look? All right, let's go to the next thing,
2:53:24
which is the quiz. The AI business quiz. So, this quiz now says, "According to
2:53:31
Alicia Little, which AI tool is particularly effective for a multimedia agency to quickly generate numerous
2:53:39
short video clips with captions from a single long form video. Now, tell me A,
2:53:46
B, C, or D if you've watched one of the podcast." This is in one of the podcasts I did with Nehemiah Davis, his Circle of
2:53:52
Greatness podcast. If you're not subscribed on YouTube, do that right now. But which which one did I cover?
2:53:59
Let's see who's got it right. Marcus says D. That's right. Opus clip. So, let's click on D. Opus clip. And click
2:54:08
next. Tama says, "I'm drinking from a water hose right now, but loving it. Lots of information and use cases coming
2:54:14
at you. But don't worry, you're going to go back over the recordings, my VIPs and platinum members." Um, okay. So, it
2:54:20
says, "When discussing the high demand for AI professionals, Alicia Little cites a LinkedIn report. Where did AI
2:54:26
consultants rank on the list of most in- demand jobs for 2025? So that was last
2:54:31
year. Which one is it? A, B, C, or D? What is the right answer?
2:54:37
Gwen, Denora, Frederick, Carina, Timothy, uh, nope. Grace is right. It is D.
2:54:44
Number two, right? And so pretty cool. And this is just going off of all of the
2:54:49
content, all those YouTube videos. You see the YouTube videos where it says select the sources. The YouTube videos
2:54:55
are the sources. We're going to click back on studio now. And now that we're in the studio we did going to move a
2:55:02
little quicker. We did the quiz. Now there's a study guide. Look at this comprehensive study guide. It pulled out
2:55:09
definitions. What is going on? Um that is so cool. We'll go back to studio.
2:55:15
And then it says um is this the data one? Look at that table. Okay. Okay. And
2:55:21
it cites the YouTube videos that that this information came from. I love that.
2:55:26
So, now let's go down to the mind map. What did you see? The mind map. Here we
2:55:33
go. All right. I love this. I love this. Perfect. So, now as you click in, I'm
2:55:40
just zooming in a little bit. Yep. We can see the different things that I talked about there. And then when you
2:55:45
click on the mind map, it opens up this chat where you can actually chat with the content.
2:55:52
Ah, it's crazy. So, how many of you are loving this notebook LM? A lot of different use cases. Okay, it's still
2:55:58
generating my three favorite things. Come on, notebook LM. Let's go. Let's go. It's still generating the audio overview, the slide deck, and the video
2:56:06
overview. But I'm going to go back to my notebook LM because I did this yesterday just in case this happened. And I'm
2:56:14
going to show you those three things. And let's start off with the audio
2:56:20
overview. The same YouTube videos. I just did this ahead of time just in case. So, what I'm going to do now is
2:56:28
actually, let me see if I can play it this way. Let's see if this plays. All right. So, this is crazy.
2:56:39
We have two artificial intelligence podcasters now discussing the content
2:56:46
on all these YouTube videos. Two AI podcasters having a conversation. Listen
2:56:51
to the voice and tell me in the chat what you think of these AI voices. I think they're phenomenal. I could listen
2:56:57
to them all day. Here we go. And that ties into a really interesting hiring recommendation I saw in the
2:57:02
sources. Before you hire another person, you hire a a different kind of role. Absolutely. The experts are all saying,
2:57:09
"Hire an AI consultant or an integrator first." This isn't just someone who knows how to write a good prompt.
2:57:14
This is a systems person. It's a system person. Their only job is to look for ways to jam AI into every
2:57:19
single process in your company. HR, finance, content, sales, all of it. They're basically your chief leverage
2:57:25
officer. I like that. Chief leverage officer. Okay. So, that role Oh, our listeners got something to share. Let's hear it.
2:57:30
Oh, I just have a question. So, what about being an AI consultant? Was there
2:57:35
ever any talk about being an AI consultant and what that's like right now?
2:57:50
Ah, you know what? It's not picking up on my audio because I don't have my audio set up. But you do.
2:57:56
Welcome back to the deep dive. Today we're doing a That's what I realized I didn't do. But when you click join, you can ask a
2:58:02
question. So, did you hear when they say, "Oh, we have somebody who who would like to say something." That was me that
2:58:09
wanted to say something. And then I click join. You can join in on the conversation. And now I can have a
2:58:14
conversation with these two audio podcasters. What in the world? To download it, you
2:58:20
press this download button and you can download the audio overview. Let me tell you the first time that I used this
2:58:25
months ago, months and months ago, I got a request from Brandy Harvey to be on
2:58:32
her podcast and I was so nervous. I'm like, Brandy Harvey's podcast? Oh, I'm nervous. Right, the day comes two days
2:58:39
before, oh, you know, I'm nervous to be on Brandy Harvey's podcast. But then I stop for a minute and I'm like, but I
2:58:44
have AI on my side because I want to win on her podcast. Like, how do I make sure that I win on Brandy Harvey's podcast?
2:58:51
So, I put the YouTube links of her past podcast episodes in there. I had ChateBT
2:58:56
tell me everything that it knew about Brandy Harvey and I uploaded that document in there. And then I asked the
2:59:05
um Notebook LM I said that I would like an overview of how to like prepare for Bry's Harvey podcast. So, my Chat GPT
2:59:13
document was preparing as a guest for the Brandy Harvey podcast show. So then
2:59:18
the morning before I generate all of this and the morning before those two podcasters, I took them on my phone when
2:59:25
I went for my morning walk and they walk me through everything. Oh, this is how Brandy Harvey communicates with her
2:59:30
guests. She does a lot of research on her guests. She likes to ask these type of questions. These are her beliefs.
2:59:36
These are how your beliefs can tie into her beliefs. And then I would stop and ask a question and say, "Well, what
2:59:41
would her audience like to hear?" Um, if it's about ChachiPT, what are they worried about? It said they're worried
2:59:47
about their security settings. A lot of them haven't used it yet. I said, "Well, if I taught that on her podcast, would
2:59:52
that get people excited?" It said yes. And then it told me that Brandy Harvey at the end of her podcast episode, she
2:59:59
takes her guests aside and she asks them a question and she puts that up on shorts on YouTube. And I said, "Well,
3:00:05
what are the questions she's likely to ask me or what question will her audience love so I can win?" And it told
3:00:11
me and it gave me some advice. And when I went there, I said, "Ask me this question." They asked me that question
3:00:17
and it became the number one short on her YouTube channel with the most views and I was like yes and this is how we
3:00:23
use artificial intelligence to win. So I went from nervous to confident because I was using notebook LM as my prep, you
3:00:33
know, my podcast prep coach. Does that make sense to everybody here? Okay. So
3:00:38
that was the audio way to use it. Let's look for the slide deck. There's the
3:00:43
briefing dock infographic. This one made a different infographic. It looks really
3:00:49
good as well. And then, oh, here's the is this the
3:00:54
slide deck? No, this is the video. Let me do the slide deck first. I'm going to leave the video for last because that is
3:01:01
that is blows my mind every time. Uh, did I not do the slide deck here? Oh,
3:01:06
here's the slide deck. So, it created PowerPoint slides for me and these look
3:01:12
good. So, here we go with the slides. And look at these slides. Tell me these
3:01:18
slides are not beautiful. Come on now. This is from the content in those
3:01:23
podcast episodes. Somebody say like this is such a good way to repurpose content.
3:01:30
Look at these slides. All right, that's slide two. Here we go with slide three.
3:01:35
What? How in the world? I don't even know. Slide four. Yes, we talked about
3:01:40
garbage in, garbage out. What? These slides look good. Monetization pathways.
3:01:47
All of the graphics it made, right? Notebook LM. Remember, it is one of Google's tools.
3:01:56
Yep. Perfect. Perfect.
3:02:02
Perfect. Yes. What? Come on now. Yes. You like that?
3:02:09
All right. Perfect. So there we go. There that. And now last but not least, I am going to show you the video. You
3:02:18
ready for the video? Right. You ready for the video? You can you can then
3:02:24
sorry the slide deck you can then import into Google Slides and put your logo on it, do different branding, all that kind
3:02:30
of stuff. Okay, let's watch this video. Now remember the audio. Could everybody
3:02:35
hear that audio? Good. You could hear the two audio podcasters. Terrell said, "This is the best $47 I've
3:02:41
ever spent on that VIP." Y'all, if you're not on VIP right now, get over to
3:02:47
VIP. Get over to VIP. What I will do um in the next few days is I'll give you I
3:02:54
have a document not handy right now, but on the best use cases of Notebook LM for business owners and entrepreneurs. So, I
3:03:02
will make sure that I add that. Carlo, Carlo's my assistant, and he's human, by the way. Somebody asked me if Carlo was
3:03:08
human or AI, but he is human. Carlo, would you just write that down and tomorrow I'll put that in the VIP
3:03:15
folder. So, I have some instructions and prompts that I use with Notebook LM to
3:03:21
be to to really master it and I'll give that to you guys. All right. Perfect. Yes. All right. Perfect. Yes.
3:03:29
Um Okay. Perfect. So, I will do that. All right. Let's let's hit play on this
3:03:34
video. And remember this is this is an AI speaker who's reading this material
3:03:41
right here. Oh gosh. So the images that you see were created
3:03:46
by notebookm and the speaker that's speaking it is AI but the speaker isn't
3:03:52
reading the slides. They understand the con content. I Let's just let's just hit
3:03:57
play.
3:04:04
Let me see. I don't hear it. Hang on one second. Try that again.
3:04:11
Let me move it to the middle and see. First things first. Here it is. Okay. Let's go back. Exactly the right place.
3:04:17
All right. Going back now. Have you ever used chat GPT, asked it to do something, and the result was just
3:04:23
kind of meh? If that sounds familiar, you are in exactly the right place. Today, we're going to blow past the
3:04:29
basics and unlock what this AI can really do. Let's jump in. Yeah, I'm sure
3:04:34
that sounds familiar, right? You've got this great idea in your head, you ask the AI for a little help, and what comes
3:04:40
back is just flat. It's generic. It's a super common frustration. But here's the
3:04:46
thing, it's not because the tool is bad. It's because nobody's really shown us the right way to use it. Well, that is
3:04:52
all about to change. All right, so here's our game plan. First, we're going to fix the foundation. Then, we'll dive
3:04:58
into a super simple but really powerful prompting method. After that, we're going to turn Chat GBT into your own
3:05:04
personal assistant that does actual work for you. And we'll wrap up with a whole new way to think about using AI to get
3:05:10
way out in front. Let's do it. Okay, first things first. We've all heard that saying, garbage
3:05:17
just the first 59 seconds of the video. And then you just hit on that download
3:05:23
button right there. And I'm going to go ahead and download it. And it just downloaded on my computer. Can you see the download spinning right there? It's
3:05:30
spinning. Spinning right there. And so now I have it and it downloads it as an MP4 video.
3:05:38
What? Amazing. So for you learning, this is
3:05:45
great. For your clients consuming your content, this is amazing. There's so many different use cases of this. Did
3:05:51
somebody tell me in the chat how you would use Notebook LM? I will tell you one of the first times that I used it, I
3:05:57
was like, I really want to be a top 1% thinker. And when it comes to personal
3:06:02
development, self-improvement, so I actually went to ChatGpt and I'm like,
3:06:08
tell me some of the top personal development and self-improvement. You can have ChatGpt agent do this for you.
3:06:14
Go search YouTube. Give me all the links. It gave me all of the links. I put it in Notebook LM. And then I asked
3:06:20
notebook LM, it created all of this. And then in the chat I said, what is a 1%
3:06:26
thinker on habits? I think I might actually have that notebook and I can
3:06:31
put it into is it this discipline and habit one? Yeah, look at this over here. So this is
3:06:40
my discipline and habit formation. And look at all of the YouTube videos I put
3:06:46
there. Back up a minute. I'm opening up a old notebook that I was using to help
3:06:52
myself build more discipline and habits. So, look at these just five habits you
3:06:58
must remove to earn respect. You can see Eric Thomas who's one of the speakers coming up, right? Eric Thomas and all of
3:07:05
these different things here. And then it came and then now it's giving me here's
3:07:10
my Oops, the infographic is already done. Master your your actions, master life. So I printed this out and this is
3:07:17
on my wall the discipline blueprint. It's creating this from the content from top thinkers and then I can ask
3:07:24
different questions of all these people. Okay. So all these top thinkers, what are three common things that they say
3:07:31
about making better habits in our life? Do you get what I'm saying? So now we're taking
3:07:37
this information and all of this content and using it in just different ways. Do you guys like that use case? Um, so
3:07:45
Chené said, "I created a lot of courses a while ago and now I can repurpose them and make them more engaging." I love
3:07:51
that. So Vanessa said for the infographic, she's going to have it summarize YouTube videos that she
3:07:58
doesn't have time to watch so she can say stay on the top in her industry. All right. So someone says, "This is going
3:08:06
to be so good for my clients. It will educate them and keep them engaged." Ken says, "It will help me with mastering my
3:08:12
Python class." So, let's see. You can upload text files
3:08:17
into Notebook LM. So, last thing, we're going to wrap up Notebook LM, but I hope everybody sees the use cases for it. But
3:08:24
in Notebook LM, keep typing your use cases in the chat. I'm reading it. I'm reading it. Jennifer said, "It will be
3:08:31
great for my patients." Um, Loren said, "I can take it to my YouTube episodes
3:08:36
and create other content." So, we're talking about content repurposing as well, right? So, lots of content
3:08:43
repurposing. So, I put my book in here and now I can take my book and give people an infographic, a video. So, now
3:08:51
for an additional fee after you purchase my book, you can also get a video overview, a mind map. Do you see where
3:08:57
I'm going with this, right? Something additional that they can buy. So, just to recap, notebooklm.google.com,
3:09:04
google.com, click on create new notebook, and then you could search the web for sources. You can upload files.
3:09:11
You can click on, you know, like this right here, which is what we did to
3:09:16
import links or or YouTube links, right? You can connect it with your Google
3:09:22
Drive, which I've done before, or you can just copy and paste text into it, and it uses that and creates all of that
3:09:29
amazing things. audio overviews, video overviews, my maps, reports, flashcards, quiz, data tables, slide decks, and
3:09:34
infographics all for you. So, I do have a notebook LM
3:09:40
overview for business owners. I will get it tomorrow and put it in the VIP
3:09:45
um folder. So, VIP, just say VIP in the chat. VIP. Yes, yes, yes. So, someone
3:09:52
said it's great for my real estate investors. Yep. I like that. So, you're using it for that use ca all these use
3:09:58
cases for it. So, I know a lot of you are going to use Notebook LM now. And did I mention that it's free? You can
3:10:05
use this absolutely free. How many of you actually did this while I was doing
3:10:10
it? You actually did it yourself? Give me a me in the chat if you did it and an emoji to show like was your mind blown
3:10:17
by it? How do you feel about it now? Lots of you did it together. Great, great, great job. Okay, so let's keep
3:10:25
going. Are you ready for more? Is everybody ready for some more goodness? All right, I want to show you another
3:10:31
Google tool for marketing and this is at Google lab. So labs.google.com,

3:11:00
else with you for the next days. Like tell a friend or two or three to make sure that they join this. We don't want
3:11:07
anybody to get left behind. Let's empower those that we love. Yes. Give me a yes in the chat if today you will tell
3:11:15
someone about what we went through today and encourage them to join. Yeah. And if they missed it, they can get VIP to buy
3:11:21
the recordings or platinum to get a platinum experience. So yeah, make sure that you spread it. My sister and I are

3:11:41
to have that family as atmosphere with our community. But anybody we love and care about, we have told them, we have
3:11:47
taught them, we have forced them to sit down and listen to me tell them, "Look,

3:12:59
anybody wants to do this with me. Okay. So I'm going to reset the business DNA.
3:13:06
That means I'm just deleting everything to start over from scratch. So right now
3:13:11
Pomelli is going to help us to create campaign ideas and creatives for our

I'm going to press continue. And then now it analyzes my website. Those of you that had that said you're going to be an
3:14:59
agency owner as well. Do this for your client website. Did I mention that it's
3:15:04
free? Like f re e free. So it's going to analyze our website. It says 5 minutes
3:15:10
left, but it's usually really quick. Okay. So now when it analyzes the website, you see how it pulled up the
3:15:16
VIP website and then uh it did it yesterday. Okay, let's try
3:15:24
it again. Enter the website. Maybe too many people are doing it right
3:15:29
now. Okay, gathering colors, studying your brand values.
3:15:36
Um, but yes, the Pomelli guide is in the VIP. All right, it's in the VIP.
3:15:44
So, let's go. Summarizing your business here. Yep. Generating your business DNA.
3:15:50
learning your Oops, I clapped and I snapped. I shouldn't have. Writing your
3:15:56
tagline, gathering colors. Um, all right. Perfect. Phil says it
3:16:03
crashes. You tried three times. That's because tens of thousands of people are hitting it right now all at the same
3:16:09
time. So, we'll give it a little bit of love and leeway. You know, Pomelly right now is like, "What is going on?
3:16:15
Everybody's hitting this site all at the same time." So, if you were able to get it, tell us in the chat that you were
3:16:21
able to get it and what you thought about it. If you're like, "Wow, this is amazing." Tell us because you might be getting it. Um, Edra said, "I really
3:16:28
needed this." Latasha said, "I got it. This is amazing." Dominique, "I got it. I got it. It's working." Um, I got it
3:16:34
and I love it. This is really awesome. Dominique said, Don says, "Yours says five minutes." Some of you say it
3:16:41
crashes and it has to come back. So, all right. So, we'll we'll give it a little bit of of time there, but it's going to
3:16:47
generate taglines for your business. Those of you who are already there, what I want you to do is I want you to click
3:16:54
on one of those boxes. It's going to give you three boxes. Click on one of
3:16:59
those boxes so that you can start to generate the brand content. It will also
3:17:05
allow you to make any changes or upload photos. Let's say you want a photo of yourself. You you see the box on the
3:17:11
right. And for the rest of you, we're going to get there in a minute. I'm just talking to people who've who are already there. And you're going to be able to
3:17:18
upload that type of, you know, images or your logo or other brand guidelines. And
3:17:23
then it's going to create these amazing marketing pieces for you. But sometimes
3:17:29
we get stuck on creating the campaign ideas. Lots of you said you wish you had a graphic designer in your business, but
3:17:35
you didn't. But now you do, so it can do this. So Vanessa says, "I got your images right here." Okay, Vaness
3:17:42
Vanessa, you bet. I love it. I love it.
3:17:47
Edra, you love it. Wow. Beth says the website labs.google.com.
3:17:55
labs.google.com. Right now it says it's pulling images, summarizing your business. So, it's
3:18:02
generating the business this this business thing. Labs.google.com.
3:18:08
Just type it in the URL. I did put it on the bottom of your notion document, the
3:18:13
day one notion document. Um, labs.google.com. And this is called Pamelli by Google.
3:18:21
All right. Pomelli by Google. While that is finishing, I'm just going to open up another window or two
3:18:29
um for where I'm going to next. How's everybody feeling? You feeling good? You
3:18:35
want some more goodness? Madura said, "This is absolutely exciting." Shannon's excited in VIP.
3:18:42
Yes, VIPs, we have that Pamelly guide for you in the VIP folder. Please make
3:18:48
sure that you go through it just to get the most out of Pamelly. I really want you to maximize this. Come on now.
3:18:54
Maximize this guide on Pamelli. Um, is that the one where I have a video
3:19:00
at the top? Do I have a video at the top on that Pomelli guide? I think so. I
3:19:06
wonder if somebody can tell me. I can't remember. Carlo, is that the one that has the video
3:19:12
um on the top? So, Felicia said, "This is more information than I expected." Good,
3:19:17
Felicia. That's my goal to make sure that that it is more in more than you expected today. That's what we always
3:19:24
aim to do. Terry said, "I'm feeling good right now. I'm feeling good." Camille
3:19:29
says, "I'm learning so much. My mind is blown." Kathy said, "It came up with great campaign ideas." is Kathy. That's
3:19:35
what I'd like to hear. So, uh, as an agency owner and we do work for clients, it takes a lot of time to come up with
3:19:41
campaign ideas, put all this together, even send the ideas to your clients. But
3:19:48
now, all of that is shortcuted thanks to AI. All right, I'm going to do some work
3:19:53
behind the scenes for the next thing that we're going to do after this, which
3:19:59
is going to be so much great use cases for your business. I like to say fun
3:20:05
because to me AI is fun. To have this type of advantage is fun, right? This is
3:20:12
fun. So, I hope you consider it fun as well. You're like, I like to have an advantage. Having an advantage is fun.
3:20:19
All right, perfect. Let me paste that here. Um, all right. So, perfect. All
3:20:25
right. It says, "Taking longer than expected. Look what you guys did to Pamelli. Look what you did to Pamelly."
3:20:33
Um, all right. Less than a minute. It has a video to
3:20:41
load. This is fun. Fonda said epic. All right. Good word to describe it.
3:20:46
So, yes. All right. Love it. Love it. Okay, come on. Come on. Come on. It
3:20:51
looks like you guys got it before me. I should not have erased my business DNA, but that's okay. I wanted to show you
3:20:57
this process. So, let's give it another determining my visual aesthetic. I'm going to give it another few seconds and
3:21:04
then I might move on and come back. But I like Kathleen said, "We broke pamelli."
3:21:10
I love it. I love it. I love it. So, yeah. I It's taking way longer. Usually
3:21:16
it takes it comes back within 60 seconds, but that's all of us using it at the same time. That's okay, though.
3:21:22
When those of you who have seen it so far, I know your mind is blown and great use cases for it. So, as you're working
3:21:29
with it, click on all three of those things. Click on the different things that it generated for you so you can
3:21:34
generate more. It will generate one campaign idea for you for um and that
3:21:42
campaign idea will generate four graphics and then you can generate four more. Do you see how you can do that?
3:21:47
And then you can keep going to generate more content. And then the other things
3:21:52
that you can do um the other things that you can do with it is that you can animate the graphic.
3:21:59
Do you see that animate button? Press on that animate button and animate that graphic. Okay, I'm probably going to
3:22:06
come back to Pamelly and then show those of you who did not do it live. I will come back to it and we will see after
3:22:13
mine is done. Y'all slowed me down now because everybody hit it, but we'll come back to it in a minute. All right. In
3:22:20
our business, we're we're Google Data Center business fellows. So, we're in this special program with Google. I'm
3:22:26

3:23:10
Now, with Google Gemini, I know that a lot of you business owners here would
3:23:17
love to be authors. You'd love to be authors. We teach this in our course AI
3:23:22
fuel profits where we teach like how to write a book in a day with Chachi BT. I've written books. A lot of our

doc and magically what magically a prompt has been added to your doc. You
3:25:01
are going to copy this prompt. We're going to take this to Google Gemini and we're going to create an ebook cover.
3:25:08
Okay. Now first let me see if Pomelli's done before I get into Gemini. Pomelly
3:25:16
taking longer than I will keep waiting. Okay. Okay. Google Gemini. Keep going.
3:25:24
Pomelly, keep going. Um, the the things that I love about
3:25:30
training and teaching. So, I'm an AI consultant. I've been training and teaching on artificial intelligence end
3:25:36
of 2022, the start of 2023. In fact, I got my nickname the queen of AI when I
3:25:43
was speaking at an event called the board of experts event and a lady in the audience named Deborah. I was showing AI
3:25:48
agents. This was January of 2023. So really early in AI training and I was
3:25:53
showing AI agents and some crazy stuff. They were writing a book with chatbt and she nicknamed me the queen of AI. But
3:26:00
the thing and then she started following me around on social media. Every time I made a post she would say that until it
3:26:06
stuck and then I had no choice. So, shout out to you, Deborah. It's a lot of fun. But the thing that I love so much
3:26:11
on training and teaching AI, and when I tell you that I train and teach AI, I'm training it in government, corporations,
3:26:19
universities. There's a big opportunities right now to teach and train in artificial intelligence. So,
3:26:25
I've trained um in government agencies, I've trained at Health and Human
3:26:30
Services, um the Department of Treasury, and they were actually a very exciting and fun group. Yep. Department of
3:26:36
Treasury. Uh let's see, Homeland Security, citizenship and immigration.
3:26:43
So, so that's federal government. I've done a lot of state, local, county government, corporation. I've done NASA.
3:26:49
I've trained at trained with Oracle. I've trained at Cisco multiple times. Great client. Love them. And I've
3:26:57
trained in the aerospace industry. Um and then small corporations.
3:27:02
I've trained at nonprofits, organizations, lots of universities. I've trained at Morehouse, Georgia Tech,
3:27:10
Georgia State, um William Patterson University a few times. The list goes on
3:27:15
and on. So, this the times that we're in today, this training that you're getting today,
3:27:22
imagine you taking this training, honing in on it, right? Honing in on it, really learning it, and then going out there
3:27:29
and teaching it and training it in the world. It's an amazing opportunity. So, okay. So, now I'm on Google Gemini.
3:27:35
Let's go back to Google Gemini here. I was just reflecting on how much I enjoy this right now, this time with you all.
3:27:41
I don't want it to end. Let's keep going. So, right here with this prompt I gave you, you're going to copy and paste
3:27:47
it into Google Gemini. And then we're going to change some things. So, do you see where
3:27:54
um look at Latana? Latana said, "I paid $900 for an upcoming book cover if I
3:28:01
would have waited." Well, guess what? The next book covers you do, they're here. But what about
3:28:08
that business opportunity? Someone here is going to turn this into a business opportunity. So many business
3:28:14
opportunities here to do this for um
3:28:19
for customers. Okay. So, book title uh let's call this AI interrupted. Okay.
3:28:26
and then subtitle if anything why you need to go all in on AI. So I
3:28:36
created this prompt to be a template for you just so you would replace some
3:28:42
things here in the template. There's a lot of you here who are already creative know what to do. You don't even have to
3:28:49
use this template if you don't want to. Just ask Gemini to create a book cover. But those of you who need it, this is to
3:28:54
make sure you don't forget anything. What is my name? Author name. Alisia Little. Gina Rivers. Put your name in
3:29:01
there. Right. Put author name. Cynthia Painter. You put Cynthia Painter. Got
3:29:06
it. Genre or category. What I like to do here is just delete what I don't need in
3:29:13
my template. So, I'm going to say it's business and AI.
3:29:20
And yeah, that's it. So, you just delete what you don't want or write in what you do want. Target audience for me. I'm
3:29:29
going to say entrepreneurs. And yeah, let's just leave that there.
3:29:35
Visual style. Change this any way you want. So, overall mood.
3:29:42
And then you just delete what you don't want. I'm going to delete the warm and
3:29:48
mysterious and leave the rest. kind of give give some moods here. Design style.
3:29:54
Uh I will do modern and illustrated. All right. Now, let me see. Is everybody
3:30:00
following me? I can see the VIPs and platinums. If you're not VIP or platinum, hurry up and get in the room
3:30:06
so I can see you. Hurry up and get in the room. Yes. Okay. Cheryl said, "I
3:30:11
love this." Okay. So, remember the prompt is on this document right here
3:30:17
that everybody has access to. Just refresh it. All right. So, now we're at Google Gemini. And then color palette.
3:30:24
You can pick your color palette or I put a default here. For those who can't pick one, just leave it as designer's choice.
3:30:31
And then the style. I'm just putting modern clean. You put whatever you want
3:30:36
there. Modern clean type. And then it says author name clearly visible. It's
3:30:43
just giving some format requirements. Change it any way you want. Brand and
3:30:48
feel. Again, that was for me. Change it any way you want. I am also going to upload my photo. So, if you want your
3:30:55
photo on the front cover, you could do that. So I will say um also
3:31:03
at the bottom I will put Brandon feel the cover at first glance
3:31:12
and include the author photo uploaded here
3:31:19
on the cover and then just click go. Okay.
3:31:25
Oh man, I forgot to click image. Uh dot dot dot copy. Let me open up Gemini
3:31:32
again. We're creating an image. Gemini at the bottom where it says create
3:31:38
image. Click on create image first to that. Make sure you don't forget. Click paste. And then I'm going to upload my
3:31:45
photo again. And let's just quick create a book cover. So VIPs in your folder you
3:31:51
will see um a document. Oh, no. The the document
3:31:58
at the end of the day today, my that everybody's gonna get. So, let me go back to this. I'm going to show you this
3:32:06
is where I created my book cover, the pocket guide to speaking AI. So, this is how I created it. It was in Gemini, but
3:32:12
I'm going to show you how to create it. So, it looks visually like this if you want to see how it does that. It looks like that. So,
3:32:19
um I also have a guide in the VIP folder. Carlo, can you drop it in the
3:32:25
VIP folder now? It's that chat GBT guide. Oh, that's the chat GBT guide to creating images. Yes, never mind. We can
3:32:32
drop that later. I think that's already in there. All right. So, let me go now. Click image. And we go. So, with Gemini,
3:32:39
I did not click images, but it still made it still made a book cover for me based on what I wanted. AI interrupted
3:32:45
why you need to go all in on AI. And I'm doing another one over here. So, it creates it all based on what you want
3:32:52
the book cover to look like. If you have any specifics, type it in. Um,
3:32:58
so if anything is misspelled, have it do it again. You can also fix that in Canva. So, I want to see what your book
3:33:07
cover looks like. So, those of you that did a book cover, put it in the chat. Let's see what these book covers look like. Come on now. Oh my gosh, Michael
3:33:14
did one. International combives. It looks fantastic, Michael. That is
3:33:20
fantastic. All right. So, trying to see if you're having trouble finding the
3:33:25
prompt, then just type in to make a book cover and some of the things that you want on your book cover. So, here's
3:33:30
mine. AI interrupted. Why you need to go all in on AI. I'm going to download this
3:33:35
book cover. Let me see those book covers in the chat. Let me see them. What? Helen's best. I love it. Helen, good
3:33:42

3:34:10
Okay. So, I want you to download your book cover. All right, everybody.
3:34:15
Download your book cover. So, you can click on your image. You'll see the download full size in the top right. If
3:34:22
you did not do it and want a book cover to play around with. I am going to
3:34:27
upload mine here in the notion doc just so you have a book cover cuz I nobody left behind. You know, that's what we
3:34:34
say. So, you'll see it right there and you can click here in the notion document and download it by looking
3:34:40
right here. Good everybody. What? Taresia, come on. That looks fantastic.
3:34:47
You guys did good. Phoenicia, I love yours, too. So, here is my AI
3:34:52
interrupted. I'll make this a little bit smaller on your Google doc. Everybody sees that. This right here, the next
3:34:58
thing I'm about to show you is how you turn this book cover to look like this for your marketing campaigns. So, I want
3:35:04
you to go to this website called DIYbook covers
3:35:09
uh.com and uh oops, I misspelled it. It's
3:35:15
actually on. Let me just go to the notion doc and click on the link. If you go to the bottom of the notion doc,
3:35:20
you'll see it right there. diybook covers.com. So, let me click on it and open it. Let
3:35:29
me open it first. Let's do this. Let me open it first because I'm afraid we'll all crash the site, which we probably
3:35:34
just did. So, let me just open it first. Let me walk you through it first. Don't anybody else go there. Probably
3:35:40
everybody did already, but let me just see if I can do it first. No, the slight
3:35:45
site is now really slow, but that's okay. So, in DIY book covers, one of the things that it's um
3:35:55
uh what maybe I'll take a quick break and then let it come back. I want to go back to Pamelly and DIY book covers and
3:36:03
then um we can dive dive deeper into this. But wait until I show you how you
3:36:09
can take this and take it to the next level with your marketing campaigns.
3:36:14
Right? So, here's what I want to do. If it's okay with you, I just need a quick five minute break. I'm going to get something to drink and I'm going to turn
3:36:21
it over to Michael who's probably going to give away something just to give me a quick break. I'm going to wait for these pages to refresh to come and show you
3:36:28
what you can do with this magic right here. I'm proud of all of you that have designed your book covers. Remember, we
3:36:34
also do have a VIP and platinum session coming up really soon. This will these five minutes will also give those of you
3:36:40
that are not in the room yet a chance to get in the room. So, if you haven't upgraded to VIP or platinum, do that
3:36:48
now. All right. Just just type in the chat on YouTube, okay? Let me know that you're about to do it and let's go.
3:36:56
Let's upgrade to VIP and platinum. I'm going to take a quick break and then I will come back to you. Five minutes. Can
3:37:02
you give me five minutes? Don't go anywhere. Do not go anywhere. In fact, find a friend or two and tell them to
3:37:08
sign up so they don't miss this part. All right, everybody. Good. Give me a thumbs up. I can see you. All of those
3:37:14
VIP platinums, give me a thumbs up. All right. Thank you, Daryl. All right, Charlene, I see you. Fondest, I see you.
3:37:22
All right, platinum. So, we will be back in five minutes. All right, Michael, turning it over to you.
3:37:28
Everybody, give it up for Alicia. Just put a fire emoji in the chat for Alisia Little. I'm so excited that you all got
3:37:34
that second segment, but like Alicia said, I got some surprises up my sleeve. As you all know, I got some giveaways
3:37:40
I'm going to be doing right here. Um, but I got I got some special surprises for the VIP and the platinum. Okay, so

3:38:35
Everybody type that in the chat. We are not done for the day. We have so much more in store for you all. And I have uh
3:38:42
big news cuz VIP and platinum uh I'm going to do a giveaway, but platinum specifically, can we add in a bonus
3:38:49
session for platinum tonight? Is that okay? Platinum's like I we we gonna be locked in. Cynthia, is that cool? Joy,
3:38:55
is that okay if we do an extra platinum session? So, we had so many people DM in
3:39:01
uh Alisi on Instagram. So many people. They said, "We need Adura back sooner.
3:39:07
Don't don't wait till tomorrow. Bring them back." And so I called Adura. Did anybody enjoy Adura's session? So he
3:39:14
said, "Hey, I want to come do He said, "Tonight I have some free time." He says, "Tonight I want to do like a late
3:39:19
night mastermind with Platinum." He says, "I want to sit down with them and actually show them deeper how to use the
3:39:25
machine I just showed them." So, Platinum, we got some great news tonight at the very very very very end of the
3:39:31
day after the VIP and Platinum Q&A with Alisia Adura is going to come up and we
3:39:36
we've talked to him. He's going to come back on and do a bonus session for you only. Okay, is that cool, Platinum? Just
3:39:41
go ahead and put yes in the chat if that's okay with you guys. I think that's pretty great, pretty pretty exciting, right? And so, the cool thing
3:39:47
is if you're here and you are in YouTube, you can upgrade to VIP or platinum. I would recommend platinum
3:39:53
because you get all lifetime access to the replays plus past summits and this
3:39:58
the extra bonus sessions. But all you have to do is go to ai businesssummit.com/upgrade. The link is going to be put in the chat.
3:40:05
So team, if you could drop the upgrade link in the chat, that would be amazing. And uh you all can go ahead do that. It's also pinned at the very top of the
3:40:12
YouTube feed. Now, if you are here and you're VIP and you're watching in Zoom, all you have to do is go to your uh go
3:40:19
to your dashboard. Can we actually show my screen? I'm going to show them. This is what the dashboard looks like right
3:40:25
here. And if you're VIP, all you have to do is click this upgrade to platinum button and it'll take you to a page
3:40:31
where you can go and actually upgrade from VIP to platinum to get access to tonight's late night talk with uh with
3:40:38
Adura. We have a platinum only networking night this weekend. So, we have so much in store for platinum. So
3:40:43
VIP uh the team's going to drop the link for you to directly upgrade in the chat. But uh you can go to your dashboard as
3:40:49
well and go click upgrade to platinum if you'd like to do that right away. Okay. So platinum, good news is you're set.
3:40:56
Nothing else for you to do except for just stay in the room. Everybody platinum. Let me just see it. Put stay in the room in the chat. Everybody just
3:41:01
put stay in the room in the chat. That's Roberto. That's all I got for you is you just got to stay right here with me. Okay, that's it. So listen, um I do have
3:41:08
one thing I want to do real quick. We have VIP and platinum in the room. Is it
3:41:14
okay if I just give away some headphones to a VIP or platinum member? Is that okay? VIP platinum. Is that cool? So, I
3:41:21
actually downloaded a list of everybody that is in the Zoom room. So, if you're
3:41:26
watching on YouTube, you can upgrade and you can actually get in Zoom with us. We have thousands of people in Zoom. But I
3:41:34
went and actually I had the team. And I said, "Hey, can you go and literally export a list of everybody who's in Zoom
3:41:40
right now?" And I put them in a giant wheel and they said, "Yeah, let's do it." So I said, "Okay, I'm going to give away some headphones." And so I'm
3:41:47
actually going to share my screen right now and I'm actually going to show the wheel of names and we're going to pick somebody at random. So if you're VIP and
3:41:54
platinum, I need you to put drum roll in the chat. I just need you to put drum roll in the chat real quick because we
3:41:59

3:42:11
into this wheel. I hope it works. All right. I'm hoping this works. So, here we go. I just clicked the button. Let's see who the winner is going to be.

3:43:49
have the itinerary for each day?" We can't release a speaker dayby-day itinerary because a lot of our speakers,
3:43:56
we we're moving things around all the time. I wish we could, but I do want to let you know what to look forward to tomorrow. Is that okay if I just at

3:45:06
starting right at 10:00 and we're going to go all day tomorrow and all day on Friday. And then VIP and Platinum, we'll
3:45:13
see you on Saturday for a special session. All right. Is that cool with you all? Is that cool? Does that Does that lineup sound good if I give you a
3:45:19
little sneak peek every day? Okay. Awesome. And amazing big hitters. Yes, Denise. Yes. We got so many so much in
3:45:25
store for the next little bit. So, this is what I need you all to do right now. This is what I need you to do. I need to
3:45:30
lock in cuz we're about to transition. Team, let me know when Alicia is ready if you could. So, this is this is what I have right now. I want to go ahead and
3:45:37
just zone in with you for a second. You're going to receive so much information this week. Is every anybody
3:45:44
in here kind of little overwhelmed? Just to be honest, like you're like, "Yo, this has been a lot." Jennifer's waving at me. She's like, "Yeah, a little bit."
3:45:51
That's okay. That's okay. I wanna I want to come back and bring you back and center you a
3:45:57
little bit. It's that's normal. We knew that you were going to be a little overwhelmed. That's what number one
3:46:04
that's why we're encouraging you to get the VIP and platinum so you can get the replays. But what I want you to do is
3:46:09
whenever she's talking, whenever these speakers are talking, I want you to ask yourself, what's one thing I can
3:46:15
implement into my life or business from this? I'm not asking you to go take 10, 20 things and go run with it immediately
3:46:22
because that'd be almost impossible, right, Joseph? I just don't think it's possible, Dr. Alita. I don't think
3:46:28
that's possible for you to take all 20, 30, 40 things you learned and go run immediately. But I just want you to ask, what's the one thing? Everybody type one
3:46:34
thing in the chat because everybody's different. And I think Bonnie, it's good to see you again. I think Bonnie, I
3:46:40
think like just that one thing. If you just focus on that and you take one step and one thing and then you take the next
3:46:46
step, then you take the next step and you go to the next thing, it's just going to be a snowball. You guys seen like a snowball rolling down a hill and
3:46:52
how it compounds and gets bigger and bigger. That's what this is going to be. So, as you're going through this, I want
3:46:57
you to slow down and know it is okay if you feel like, hey, this is a lot
3:47:02
because that's that is normal for an event like this. But what I want you to do is come up with a strategic action plan. Everybody
3:47:09
put strategic action plan in the chat.
3:47:18
I want you all to create a strategic action plan from this event of things you can implement and start with that
3:47:25
one thing. The ones that go from here and actually do sit down and analyze, okay, how does
3:47:31
this apply to me, my business, my life, they're going to get a whole lot more out of it? and they're going to come
3:47:36
back a year later and say, "Alisia, I took I took what you gave me and I put in an action plan and I went and ran the
3:47:42
play, actually did the thing, and now my life's different."
3:47:47
So, don't just take this information, put on the shelf. Don't try to do everything at once, but do it one step at a time. You guys got me? Just put got
3:47:54
you in the chat if you understand. Put got you in the chat if you understand.
3:48:02
I love it. I love it. I love it. So, I got put or Linda said, "Put 100%." I
3:48:09
love it. Awesome. So, this is what I want to do. This is what I want to do. I'm going to
3:48:15
go ahead and let you all know that we do have I don't know. Should I let more
3:48:20
surprises out? I I'm texting the team like, "Should I let them know about these surprises? Should I let them know
3:48:26
about these surprises?" I don't know. I don't know. We got so much in store, y'all. The team brought
3:48:32
me more gifts. They brought me more stuff and I'm trying to figure out what I can let you
3:48:37
guys know about or not. Okay, I'm not even though you guys want me to let you all know about the giveaways, I'm going to wait just a little bit. Let me see.
3:48:46
Okay, the team said no, they said they should wait. Okay, the team just told me to wait a little bit for the bigger surprises. Okay, so we do got some big
3:48:52
surprises though. Just hang tight to the very end. Um, but this is what I want to say. Day four, uh, we had a a few people
3:48:58
just message us recently and I wanted to clarify this. They said, "Hey, um, what is the day for? What is that Saturday
3:49:05
session?" So, I just want to before I bring up Alicia, you guys ready for Alicia to come back up? You guys ready?
3:49:11
So, I want to let you know that Alisia um and the team is hosting this Saturday
3:49:17
a full day of learning starting at 10:00 a.m. again, and it's going to go until 2 or three with guest speakers. So, but
3:49:24
that's only for VIP and platinum. All right, that's only for VIP and platinum. So, just want to let you know that
3:49:31
that's available. It's going to be open. That's why we're encouraging you to jump in. I think is it okay? I'm going to let
3:49:36
you all know a little of the topics that we're doing on day four. Day four topics are YouTube and media with AI. Grants
3:49:44
with AI. Uhoh. Uhoh. Uhoh. Business structure, how to set up your business
3:49:50

3:49:56
platinum, just so you know. but it's a bonus session that you make sure you want to be a part of. So, we got that's just a few. I left out two or three
3:50:02
different topics because I want to leave those as surprises. But, long story short, upgrade if you can. Go check your
3:50:08

3:50:15

3:54:26
book covers that we're seeing here." So, how do you feel about the fact? Who's
3:54:31
the person that just paid someone $900 to do their book cover? Who's that person here? Put $900 in the chat. or if
3:54:38

$1,200 to get her book cover done.
3:55:05
Um, Jeriah says, "People pay me to do covers. I start at $1,500."
3:55:13
Okay, so we have someone here who does this as a business and gets paid to do it at $1,500.
3:55:20
Uh, Katherine does it $900 plus hundreds on revisions. All right,
3:55:27
Georgia said, "I did it for $1,200." Hello, everybody. Somebody say money in
3:55:32
the chat. Say money money in the chat. Hello. Say money in the chat. Great
3:55:38
opportunities here, not just for yourself, but think about these as great things to do for client work. Heck, hire
3:55:44
your kids to do these. Put them to work. But great book covers done today. I will
3:55:50
say that you all did amazing book covers. And I can see some of you have uploaded more than one book cover in the
3:55:56
chat. So, you are officially addicted to creating book covers now with AI. That's
3:56:02
okay. All right. Perfect. Let's keep going. Um, now I want to to write some
3:56:09
sales copy and email copy. So, continuing with the marketing. So, we
3:56:15
are going to leave the book covers. Unfortunately, I have to leave Pamelly. I'll come back to this tomorrow. So, if
3:56:22
everybody's okay with that either later today or tomorrow, I'll come back to Pamelly. It needs some time. Love you,
3:56:27
Pamelly. Come back to us later. Um, but we are going to transition away from the
3:56:33
books, the book covers. Good job everybody. I'm giving you a round of applause and you did so good. Simone,
3:56:39
diabetes simplified looks amazing. You can also make album covers like, you
3:56:44
know, make it look like an album cover and keep going with this. This is your social media graphics, your somebody
3:56:50
tell me what other graphics are you going to use. These are to make your flyers for your business events, uh, for
3:56:57
your meetups, for your upcoming Zoom sessions you want people to join. So,
3:57:03
give me some other use cases of what you could do. H Melanie, you said your Pomelly came up. Ma, yours looks
3:57:09
amazing. Platinum. Mika, you're always platinum. Ma Clifton, yours looks amazing. Angela says she's going to
3:57:16
increase her book cover prices now. Come on, Angela. Schwanda said for speaking engagements. I love that. Frederick,
3:57:22
your cover looks amazing. Shereice says, "Movie posters." Um, Barrett says,
3:57:28
"Podcast graphics." Come on, Barrett. This is right. Alita Sling Sllinchy,
3:57:35
better impact, make impact. Your book cover looks amazing. So, flyers for my books, flyers for
3:57:42
advertisements. S you guys have the business cases on lock. So, keep typing them in the chat to help everyone else
3:57:49
get some other ideas how they can do this for business. April, your curriculum book cover looks fantastic.
3:57:57
Okay, so let's go back to chat GPT for a minute. Display banners, right? Leanne
3:58:03
said, "Is there a prompt for the book cover?" Leanne, it's on our notion document, but you have to scroll down to
3:58:11
the bottom um blah blah blah right here. and it says Gemini book cover generator
3:58:17
prompt as a template. So this is the template but once you get used to it type anything in just the style what the
3:58:23
book cover you want is the audience is think about that and it will create an amazing book cover for you. Okay so
3:58:28
we're going to go back to chat GPT and we're going to turn chat GPT into our copywriter. One of the best use cases
3:58:35
for chat GPT for business, especially a business that has a database or is about
3:58:43
to start having a database is to write newsletters or emails and then to write
3:58:49
the sales copy and the landing page copy. You all are here because you got an email. How many of you got an email
3:58:56
from me or my team? How many of you got an email? Type me in the chat. Let me see how many of you got the emails from
3:59:02
me. Yeah, the sending the emails is so important, but writing emails is not always that easy. So, chatbt though can
3:59:10
help us to write emails. So, I'm going to show you something fun to turn into
3:59:18
an email sequence. Um, and this one I'm just going to show
3:59:24
you and then we're going to do some other things with emails. This one I
3:59:29
just love doing. I love this example. Okay. So, in this example, I'm going to
3:59:34
have chatbt act as two elite copywriters. First of all, I've been paying copywriters before AI a lot of
3:59:42
money. A lot a lot of money. Anybody here ever paid a copywriter how much did you pay that copywriter to write copy
3:59:49
for you? Either for your sales page, your emails, your landing page. Type in the chat how much you paid a copywriter.
3:59:55
I showed this example once at a on stage Lamar Tyler's traffic sales and profits event. And I was on stage. I showed
4:00:02
everybody how to write email copy. These two ladies came up to me at the after I was done. I got off stage. They looked
4:00:08
upset. And the lady told me, she's like, "I am so mad right now. I paid $1,600
4:00:13
for email copy. It took two weeks, then three revisions. I'm four weeks into it.
4:00:19
Still don't feel like I have my great email copy. And if I would have just known this before, I'm like, well, you
4:00:25
know it now." So continue to grow and multiply and expand your business and send out those emails. Antonette said
4:00:31
$1,200. Wendy said $1,500. Yep. So to to write some email copy. So
4:00:39
we're going to turn ChateBT into our copywriter. So I'm telling Chachi BT act as two elite copywriters with distinct
4:00:45
styles. These are two of my favorite copywriters, Alex Hermoszi and Myron Golden. And then here is the offer. So
4:00:54
now you want to give it context for the offer. So the event name, I have an
4:00:59
upcoming mansion mastermind. It's our AI mansion mastermind. So let me just put
4:01:05
AI in front of it. And it's a two to three day immersive experience. We rent
4:01:12
luxury mansions and we invite a small intimate group to come bring your laptop, learn AI. But I need my sales
4:01:19
copy written and my emails written so I can send you an email. Trust me, you will get an email for it. Um, and then
4:01:25
here's my audience. Highle entrepreneurs, founders, consultants, executives, that's you. The outcome I
4:01:31
want, strategic clarity, the positioning. It's a paid premium master class, not a free event. But here's what
4:01:37
I want chatbt to do. Step one, Alex Hermoszi version. Write email sales copy
4:01:43
as if you were Alex Heroszi. Requirements: direct, logical, outcome driven. Focus on ROI, leverage,
4:01:51
opportunity cost, speed, decision- making. It goes down. And then label this section clearly. Email copy Alex
4:01:57
Heroszi style. Then do it Myin Golden version. I love Myin. I've known him for 22 years now. He will be um speaking. So
4:02:07
make sure that you pay attention and lock in. You will get so much wisdom from that man. So now it says write it
4:02:12
as if you were Myron Golden. And here are the requirements. write that section as Myin and then have Myron critique
4:02:19
Alex's email copy in Myin's voice and then have Alex critique Myin's email
4:02:25
copy and then label this section Alex reviews Myin then Myin and then have the
4:02:31
two of them have a conversation going back and forth and they should discuss exclusivity like all the things that
4:02:37
they should discuss then they write a final agreed email. So the two of them are coming together to do this. So, how
4:02:44
many of you know Alex and Myin? How many of you know who both of these
4:02:52
uh are people are? So, a lot of you know them both. How much would they charge me
4:02:58
to write the sales copy, then sit down at a table and talk to each other and analyze each other's sales copy, and
4:03:05
then have a conversation and come back to me and give me the final version?
4:03:10
Someone tell me how much that would cost me. $100 million, Yianiraa said. And that is
4:03:17
probably right. Let's just say this. Neither one of them would do it. Nei
4:03:23
neither one of them would do it. Or maybe for $100 million they would do it. So now we're going to have Catchy PT do
4:03:31
this for us. Is this fun? Yes. Are we good with that? So all right. I gave that to ChatC PT and Catchy PT is going
4:03:37
to do this for us. All right,
4:03:42
$100 million. That's funny. This prompt is nowhere. This is just a example that I'm showing you. But here we go with
4:03:49
step one is email copy Alex for Mosie style subject. A faster way to solve the
4:03:55
problems slowing your business down. You don't need more information. You need fewer variables, better decisions, and
4:04:00
faster execution. That's what small rooms are for. Large events give you ideas. Small rooms give you ad uh
4:04:06
answers. The AI mansion mastermind with Alicia Little 2-day immersive experience. Here's the math. So, it gets
4:04:12
in. Alex, the room is capped for a reason. Alex would talk about that. Small groups outperform large events
4:04:17
because you get direct access, not stage access. Okay, I like it. Step two, myin
4:04:23
golden style. Now, I want you to remember even though it's writing it Alex style and Myronin style, the tone
4:04:30
and style is still me, Alicia Little, because remember in settings and personalization, I put in my tone and
4:04:37
style. So, this is like me and my voice
4:04:42
how I would say things, but with the flavor of Alex and the flavor of Myron. Pretty cool. So, now my go golden cell.
4:04:50
Not every opportunity is meant from for everyone. Some rooms are entered by curiosity. Others are entered by a
4:04:57
calling. The AI Mansion mastermind with Alicia Little is not a conference. It's a consecrated space for clarity,
4:05:03
correction, and confirmation. Here's the truth most high achievers eventually face. God does not bless confusion. He
4:05:09
blesses obedience. When you're stuck, it's rarely because you lack ability. It's usually because you lack
4:05:15
perspective. And it goes on. All right. Good job. And then now step three, Myin
4:05:20
reviews Alex's copy. Alex's copy is strong in logic and consequence. It clearly answers the question, why does
4:05:27
this matter? But what's missing is meaning. You show the cost of delay, but you
4:05:32
don't show the responsibility of acceleration. You speak to what they gain financially, but not to who they
4:05:38
become by deciding blah blah blah. So he says the copy convinces the mind. It does not yet complete the soul. This is
4:05:46
Myin critiquing Alex's copy. Now, Alex reviews Myron's copy. Myron, the
4:05:52
conviction is clear and the positioning is powerful. The issue is specificity. You talk about calling in alignment, but
4:05:58
you don't clearly define what changes after the event. So, two of them critiquing. Now, both of them are coming
4:06:04
together and having a conversation. And we're in the room. Alex, small rooms
4:06:10
work because they remove noise and force decisions. This has to be obvious immediately. Myin says, "Agreed."
4:06:16
Oh my gosh. I'm done, y'all. I'm done. I am done. This is too good.
4:06:25
I am done. Okay, agreed. But decisions are not just tactical, they're
4:06:31
spiritual. People delay because they do not recognize the weight of the moment. Alex comes back to Myron and says,
4:06:36
"True, but if they cannot see the return, they hesitate. I want them thinking, if I skip this, I am choosing
4:06:42
to move slower, Myin. And I want them thinking, if I skip this, I'm ignoring an invitation meant for me. Alex, we can
4:06:49
do both. Show the cost of staying the same and the responsibility of stepping up. Myron says, "Exactly, Alex. The
4:06:56
right person should feel this unavoidable, not because of pressure, but because of alignment." Alex says,
4:07:01
"Then the CTA has to be decisive. Apply now. Limited spots fast decision." My says, "And framed as stewardship. If you
4:07:09
are accepted, honor the invitation." Oo, that is so good. That is so good. Alex says, "Logic gets
4:07:15
them to the next stage." page. Myron said, "Convict conviction gets them to say yes." So, step number six, the final
4:07:22
mansion mastermind email copy approved by Alex and Myin. There are moments when
4:07:28
staying where you are is more expensive than moving. This is one of them. The AI
4:07:33
Mansion mastermind with Alicia Little is a private 2 to three-day immersive experience for highlevel entrepreneurs,
4:07:38
founders, consultants, and executives who need clarity now, not someday. This is why the room is small. Big events
4:07:45
inspire, small rooms decide. In this environment, your your real challenges
4:07:51
are worked on in real time. Bottlenecks are identified, decisions are made, execution paths are clarified. You are
4:07:57
not paying for information. You are investing in speed, perspective, and
4:08:02
proximity to people who think at your level. The luxury mastermind is intentional. It removes distraction and
4:08:09
creates separation. When the noise is gone, truth shows up quickly.
4:08:15
If you're leading something meaningful, delay is not neutral. It compounds quietly. Some will read this and move
4:08:21
on. Others will recognize that this room solves the problem that they have been carrying alone. If you're accepted, it's
4:08:28
because the room matches where you are headed. Apply now. Spots are limited and decisions are made quickly. Apply for
4:08:34
the AI Mansion mastermind. Hello. I just did $100 million
4:08:41
in email copy just like that. Okay. So now it says if you want next we can
4:08:48
adapt this for SMS or a private LinkedIn message. So I'm going to say can you
4:08:54
write an email sequence? I need a 7day sequence.
4:09:03
Um, uh, and then I'm going to say D like
4:09:10
that. So now it can just, you can just keep going with what you want them to do. So now they'll write your 7-day
4:09:16
premium uh, email sequence. So it's saying day one introduces the room, day
4:09:21
two to five increases in inevitability, and day six through seven applies
4:09:27
urgency without discounting or desperation. Each email stands alone but compounds powerfully. That's exactly
4:09:34
what I wanted. Day one. Day two. Why small rooms win. Ooh, that is good. Most
4:09:39
people do not realize this until later in their career. Scale teaches exposure. Small rooms teach execution. Ooh, I like
4:09:46
that. Day three, the cost of delay. Waiting feels safe. It also quietly
4:09:51
compounds cost. Every decision delays execution. Every unresolved bottleneck
4:09:57
drains momentum. Y'all see that? Day four, the identity shift. Day five, what actually happens inside. Day six, it's
4:10:03
still writing. Look as it's writing scarcely without apology and it's writing it in the style of these two
4:10:09
guys together. What? This one is not in notion. This
4:10:15
one will be available later to platinum. I just need to copy and paste it and put it put it in. But I just wanted to show
4:10:21
you what's happening right now. So now I can say, okay, write the sales copy for
4:10:29
the page. Oh, not the same as copy, the sales copy. The sales copy for the page. And
4:10:38
then it'll write the sales copy. And you just keep going like this. So one, one
4:10:43
day we were having a meeting with the whole team and we were talking about doing a summit. And in doing a summit,
4:10:49
all the things that are needed for the summit, all of the pages, the thank you pages, all of the emails that need to get done. And usually for a launch like
4:10:57
that, it's going to take four to six weeks to put all of these creatives together. But while the team meeting was
4:11:03
going on, I was writing all of the copy at the same time. By the end of the team meeting, copied and pasted everything
4:11:08
into notion. Sales copies done, email sequences is are done. SMSs are done.
4:11:14
The thank you page copy is done. Done. done and done. Somebody put done and
4:11:19
done in the chat. Done, done, and done. Done, done, and done in the chat. So,
4:11:24
this is what what you get when you truly leverage artificial intelligence. And that's my
4:11:31
main message to you today is that you need to leverage artificial
4:11:37
intelligence. And as you leverage AI, you're really stepping into a time where you're saying, "Yes, I want to take this
4:11:44
and run with it." Like when you see what you're doing right here. Look here. Now
4:11:49
it's writing sales copy for me. Look at this. Can you copy and paste? Who here
4:11:55
can copy and paste? Right now, let me ask you a question. Who can see
4:12:01
themselves doing this? Who can now say, "Yes, I can write my email copy. Yes, I
4:12:06
can write my sales pages. Yes, I can write those SMS messages I want to send out. I can write my copy for LinkedIn.
4:12:12
Give me a yes in the chat." Oh, Inger said, "As a copywriter, I love this." You just had a copywriter say that they
4:12:20
love this. A cop any other copywriters on here, check in and say, "Copywriter here and tell me what you thought about
4:12:27
this process." Cuz the copywriter can then take their winning copy, train
4:12:32
chatbt on their winning copy, and say, "I want you to write copy like this, right, in this style and tone." And
4:12:38
boom, they're writing copy at a level that they have never written copy before. And what happens when you're
4:12:45
able to service more clients? Where does your income go when you're able to service more clients? Someone tell me
4:12:52
what happens what happens to your income, right? And then think for a minute, what would this cost if if I had
4:12:59
to hire someone to do this for me? I don't have to because I know AI as you do now, but if I had to hire somebody to
4:13:06
do this for me, someone said it would cost a hundred million dollars to get these two guys to do that. The honest
4:13:12
truth is they probably wouldn't do that based on wouldn't do this based on their busy schedules and their client base,
4:13:19
but maybe it would cost me $80,000,
4:13:24
$80 to $100,000 to do that. So my goal for you here today, are you ready for
4:13:29
this? My goal is that I'm teaching you what you can do now for yourself in your
4:13:35
business, for your future business. Lots of you on here said you have a future business coming. And then what you can
4:13:40
also do for other businesses as the agency model, people will be hunting you
4:13:46
down if you can provide results like this for them. Everybody agree? Give me
4:13:52
an agree in the chat. If you know that you providing results like this to
4:13:57
people will cause you to be so valuable, so in demand. Give me an agree. And if
4:14:03
you agree to that, I want everybody else to see. Like if you know that that is true, help me in telling the other
4:14:09
people in the chat that might not know this industry that well or be agency owners or just stepping into their first
4:14:15
business that there's a lot of opportunity here. Yes, that there's a lot of opportunity here. Yes. Let's
4:14:23
continue to talk about opportunity. And I want to really focus for a minute on
4:14:30
um what we taught here today. If you guys can pull up my slides, what we taught here today and doing a recap and
4:14:36
then and then I'm also going to get into some vibe coding and software solutions and what we can do with that as well.
4:14:44
But when we really step into what has happened here today, I want to
4:14:50
pause for a moment and recap. And we started off with a chatg
4:14:56
walkthrough, making sure everybody felt comfortable with chatg can take it to the next level. taught you chatgpt um
4:15:03
images create marketing promotions for your business. Now, we really talked a
4:15:09
lot about different tools like Notebook LM. We talked about Google Gemini. We
4:15:15
went through Palamelly. Like, we've we've done so much today. How are you feeling about yourself? And you all did
4:15:21
so much today. We talked about email writing, sales, copy, and a and we also
4:15:28
talked about the fact that I have a book for you. Let me just pull it up. I'm just going to pull it up on the screen. A book for you. It's my ebook available
4:15:35
at the end of today's presentation. So stay tuned for that. The pocket guide on speaking AI because remember I talked
4:15:42
about this at the very beginning that LinkedIn says that AI literacy is the number one skill to have. So I created
4:15:50
this with you in mind that I want to make sure that your AI liter literacy
4:15:56
skills is at an all-time high. So you've got to grab this. Remind me at the very end. I will drop it to everybody at the
4:16:03
very end because you will be so prepared for the times that we're in today. AI
4:16:09
literacy. Okay. The pocket guide to speaking AI. I love this. It has over 50
4:16:15
essential terms made simple that you really need to know and it gives real examples. So I'm like an example of
4:16:21
this. What's what is vibe coding and what's the example? What does rag mean and what's the example? So you're going
4:16:27
to dive into that. Everybody excited for that? Just say gift in the chat just if you're excited about the gift that
4:16:33
you're going to get at the end. So you get a gift at the end. Gift. G gift. All right. AI literacy. I want to make sure
4:16:40
this is what I give all of my team members to make sure that they are all AI literate. They have to go through
4:16:46
this and then so I'd recommend that that you get this at the end. All right. And if you're a business owner, you have
4:16:51
permission to give this to your team. Those business owners, give it to your team members. Okay. Good. Even better. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. So great on the
4:16:59
recap. Um, and we've done a lot today, but it's been
4:17:04
really exciting. But let's just take a poll. Let me let me feel you out for a
4:17:10
second here. And just a a quick break to say that we have a VIP session and
4:17:16
platinum session coming up soon. If you haven't upgraded yet, you're watching this on social, do that now. Okay, back to All right, let's go back to the poll.
4:17:23
Okay, so um, one or two. This was good. you learned a lot, but it's a lot of
4:17:28
information. Or number two, you're like, "This was good, but I need more help implementing this." Or if it's both, let
4:17:34
me know in the chat. Somebody said, "Woohoo! I love that." Yeah, it's been a lot, but
4:17:41
it's been good. Yes, you you've had a good time here today. Both. It's been a lot, but you need more help implementing
4:17:47
it. Well, I'm your AI coach. I'm your AI coach and trainer, so I'm here to help you in implementing that because I know
4:17:54
that you also want more. So, you've said this already to me, but give me a more
4:17:59
in the chat if you also want more. I want to make sure that in the AI revolution, you are dialed in in the AI
4:18:06
revolution. This is a passion of mine and a mission. Like, let's make sure that people are dialed in. There is so
4:18:13
much opportunity for all of us. No scarcity mindsets here. Everyone can win
4:18:19
with AI. Everyone can win with AI. So, yes, I said I'm your AI coach. Do I have
4:18:24
permission to say that? If I do, just just type hey coach in the chat or hey AI coach in the chat. I love doing what
4:18:33
I do. Like I love being this AI coach for you. For those of you who didn't know, I actually went to the University
4:18:39
of Michigan to get my PhD, but I dropped out of the PhD program because entrepreneurship was so good for me. But
4:18:46
I really wanted to be a professor. Like that was my thing. I wanted to be a professor. But as an entrepreneur, I was
4:18:52
making a professor salary every single month. So I said, "All right, I'm not going to be a professor, but I get to
4:18:58
live that dream out of being a professor here with you as your AI coach or your AI professor." So, thank you for for
4:19:04
helping me with that. So, thank you, Joy Lita. I'm seeing all your comments here. Yes. Hey, coach. All right. Perfect.
4:19:11
Thank you so much. All right. Well, yes, I'm your AI coach now. I'm your AI coach and trainer. So, when we talk about AI
4:19:20
and how you're leveraging it from today on, you're dialed in, you're leveraging it. I'm your AI coach. The problem is
4:19:25
not a lack of tools. The problem is that you don't know really how to take all of this, like how do you take everything
4:19:32
that you've learned and how do you create it into a system that pays you? We've talked about great ideas today.
4:19:38
You put great ideas in the chat, but how do you really do that? You have chatbt, you have Gemini, now you have notebook
4:19:44
LM, you've got prompts, you've got ideas, but what you don't have is a road map that connects it all that connects
4:19:51
the AI to real business outcomes. You don't have that yet, but you're not
4:19:56
behind. You're just missing a system. So, how would you like to use AI as a
4:20:02
skill? Yes, AI is a skill. AI is a system. AI is a stream of income and AI
4:20:08
to save time. All of these puts you in a category of your own, right? And all of
4:20:16
them are so necessary. How would you like to use AI for that? Yes. Good. Yeah. Everybody says all of the above.
4:20:22
Yes, please. Well, introducing AI fuel profits. This is my course that my
4:20:28
myself, my sister, and my amazing team have put together to help you get to that next level with artificial
4:20:35
intelligence. But let me answer this question first. Why in the world did we create this program? Like why didn't we
4:20:42
just keep all this AI goodness to ourselves and keep expanding and multiplying our business? I will say
4:20:48
that every year gets better and better as we integrate AI. But when you really
4:20:54
dig deep with AI in our business last year, we made a year's salary in a month
4:21:02
gamechanging. But you have to commit to really learning it, executing it, and understanding what you need to know. So,
4:21:07
we created this program because we're winning with AI and we're passionate about those entrepreneurs who want to do
4:21:13
the same thing. I've had so many people come up to me, you know, in the years and say, I really want to win. Can you
4:21:21
coach me? And although I can't do one-on-one coaching, I'm like, yes, I can create a program where I can coach
4:21:28
you and help you to win, too. You win and you win and you win. We all win. All
4:21:33
right. So, AI Field Profits is not just a course. It's a step-by-step system that really shows you how to turn
4:21:40
artificial intelligence into a real business and a real income stream.
4:21:45
Money. Money. We have a step-by-step road map and I'm walking you through this road map. The first step is the
4:21:53
foundation and this is where you set up the mindset, the skills, and the basics needed to win with AI. You hear me
4:22:00
talking about that a lot like I want you to win with AI. So, we don't just teach you how to work with AI or use AI. It's
4:22:07
about winning with AI. We're here to win. Number two is your profit path.
4:22:13
This is your road map. So, the second part of your road map is your profit path. This is how do you create the
4:22:18
fastest AI income path based on your time, your skills, and like what your
4:22:24
goals are and what you're good at. Profit path number three or your road
4:22:29
map number three is to master AI tools. I love AI tools, but you really need to
4:22:36
know how to use them to work faster and get real results. I cannot tell you the
4:22:41
amount of time that I spend really learning these AI tools, digging all in
4:22:46
with you for you. We're so serious about this in our business that every morning
4:22:52
at 9 a.m., every morning at 9:00 a.m., we have one person on our team who's
4:22:57
hired to give us the latest briefs on AI tools. I used to work at the White House
4:23:03
under the Clinton administration and I worked in the environmental office and I remember this was the biggest aha moment
4:23:10
for me when I worked there and I so I'm my background by the way is in in the
4:23:17
environment. So environment I'm an environmentalist and a geologist. So I learned I was hugging trees
4:23:25
trees and rocks let's just say that. And now I'm doing AI. So you do not need a tech background to do AI if that tells
4:23:30
you anything. Anyway, when I worked there, there was this team of eight people who every morning before the
4:23:36
president or vice president would walk through the office, and this is back in the day. So, they would have all these newspapers that came into the office and
4:23:43
they would start clipping the newspapers and getting the latest environmental updates and then they would organize
4:23:49
them and it took them hours and they did it early in the morning and then the president or vice president would walk
4:23:55
through, they would give their quick morning briefing on what's happening in the environment everywhere. you know,
4:24:00
he's like, "Uhhuh, uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh. Moving on to the next office." But I was like, I told my sister Lorett that story
4:24:08
and I said, "What if we could get this for our whole team where we had one person that was getting all of the
4:24:13
briefs?" You don't have to clip newspapers anymore. All of the briefs. He used chat GPT schedule task among
4:24:19
other tools and then presenting it to the whole team so that the whole team knows what the latest tools are. I know
4:24:25
the latest tools and then we can present it to you as well. So we spend um a lot of time and resources making sure that
4:24:32
you get the best of the best when it comes to mastering AI tools. All right. And so using the tools to work better,
4:24:39
be stronger. Now it's also about turning the building systems is the next one on your road map. Number four, turning your
4:24:45
work into systems that run without you. How many of you are excited about that? Like just go to sleep and have your AI
4:24:51
agents doing the work for you. Yep. And then number five, attracting customers.
4:24:58
So how do you bring in the right people to buy? And then scaling. So scaling and stacking, grow what works and add new
4:25:05
income streams. So this is your step-by-step road map that you will get today with AI fuel profits. It's about
4:25:11
this system, right? We built a system that is built um and and we're working
4:25:16
with these AI systems so that you will be earning with artificial intelligence. All right. So, in two weeks, this is
4:25:24
what you're going to say. Like, I've made more progress than I have in the previous several months. This is somebody that that told us what she's
4:25:30
done with the program, but you're going to say the same thing. I built two landing pages, began rebuilding my ebook
4:25:35
in my authentic voice, and created a complete master plan to help formally incarcerated individuals. She keeps
4:25:42
going about how she was stuck, but now she has clarity and momentum. That's all some of you need. Clarity, momentum,
4:25:48
your road map, your path, and your coach. Um, Shia said this. She said, "I
4:25:53
sat on it for two years, but I used Bookbot Pro." So, today we made your
4:25:59
book cover. Everybody, you made fabulous book covers. Now, you need to write your book. So, we have a tool inside of the
4:26:05
program called Bookbot Pro that helps you to write your book. And it's something that I created. It'll ask you
4:26:12
questions. It'll keep going with this flow for you. Your book will be done. I'm so excited for you. The cover's
4:26:17
already done. Go, go, go, go. So, she said she used Bookbot Pro to expand a book I had written and it's fantastic.
4:26:24
How many of you are going to write that book? The cover's done. You're going to use Bookbot Pro. You're going to write that book. Come on now. Authors, just
4:26:31
say me in the chat. I want to see you. Marsha, Georgia, Tamika, Daniel, Sabrina, Major. Yes. All right. You have
4:26:38
a book inside of you. A lot of you, you've got knowledge and gifts, like gifts that you need to share with other
4:26:44
people. Get it out. This is how you do it. says, "I'm organizing the final details for publishing. It's it is one
4:26:50
in a five volume series and I sat on it for two years." So, if you've sat on that book idea, we have a tool that will
4:26:56
help you to get it done. Get it done. You'll meet a lot of our students who are best-selling authors now books that
4:27:02
they wrote with Bookbot Pro. Here's Michelle said, "Secured to funeral home
4:27:08
clients. I created automated obituary design templates for funeral homes to
4:27:13
purchase. I'm just showing you this. You could be in any industry, any business. You could be an agency. You could be
4:27:19
creating things for businesses. I launched a monthly partnership program for ongoing obituary graphic design and
4:27:26
sent 20 outreach emails. Who do you think wrote those outreach emails? Do
4:27:31
you think Michelle did? Chat PT. Very good. Yep. Um, inviting funeral homes to
4:27:36
a free call on how to scale their business using AI. You all should take a screenshot of this right here because
4:27:42
this is your game plan. Once you're on the inside, you'll know how to do all of this. Uh, as a result of these efforts,
4:27:48
I successfully secured two funeral home clients. I also supported a friend in launching a podcast using chat GBT and
4:27:54
creating an AI twin for marketing. You learn all of that in the course. Good. Yes. Great. Somebody say this is great
4:28:01
in the chat. Say this is great in the chat. Complete company rebrand. Rebrand. So Felicia said, "I completely rebranded
4:28:08
my company using chatbt, including a newsletter sent to members and coordinated social media announcements,
4:28:14
posting Gemini generated images." You got you started that today. Immediately
4:28:19
increased engagement. We're hearing that all the time like these amazing images you can create with AI can increase the
4:28:27
engagement for your business or for your clients with visible comments and attention across all platforms. This has
4:28:33
been one of the best investments I've made this year. Alicia and Lorett genuinely care about the success of
4:28:38
everyone in their programs. So true. And it shows in the results. So, I'm so excited for you to say that today. This
4:28:45
has been the best investment I've ever made. Those of you who spent your time here today and are VIP and platinum,
4:28:50
you've already said that in the chat. Best investment ever. So, thank you. If you believe today was your best
4:28:57
investment ever of time and those of you who upgraded to get the replays and special access, say best investment ever
4:29:04
in the chat. I'm going to keep that going. I'm going to keep that going. Best investment ever. And you're going
4:29:10
to say that today as you join AI fueled profits. Jamilia said, "Clarity,
4:29:15
structure, and a repeatable system. I booked a client. I used AI to reposition their brand and built complete business
4:29:21
plan, 91-day launch calendar, and a weekly execution workflow using AI. Because of AI fuel profits, instead of
4:29:28
scattered learning, I now have clarity, structure, and a repeatable system that makes it easier to move from idea to
4:29:34
daily execution. This is the time right now. Artificial intelligence makes it so
4:29:40
much easier to move from idea to execution, final product monetization.
4:29:47
You just have to know how to do it. So whether you need to get clarity, a launch or relaunch your first AI powered
4:29:54
product and offer, start getting leads and making sales without tech skills or a big audience. This is what AI profits
4:30:02
is about. So let's take a sneak peek inside the AI fuel profits curriculum. Are you ready? Just type ready in the
4:30:08
chat if you're ready to see uh a sneak peek. I like doing the sneak peek. Number one, it's a hybrid learning
4:30:13
environment. So, oh, wait till you see Oh, I'm not I'm not there yet, but
4:30:19
hybrid learning. So, you learn at your own pace in an online portal, but you
4:30:25
also have live training. Wait till you see what I have for you in live training. It's not Yes, we have live
4:30:31
training like this, but wait, but just wait till you see. I have a pretty slide for it. So, I don't want to release the
4:30:36
cat out of the bag yet. But you will see when you log in, I don't even need to go
4:30:41
through everything that's in here. I just want you to see that when you log in, you have your lessons. There's attracting customers, AI tools mastery,
4:30:49
create and selling an online course using AI. You'll go through the course, learn all of this. There's also a
4:30:56
section in there. Let me see where it is. Oh, bonuses. AI sales mastery, how to build custom GPTs, and the 30-day
4:31:03
launch challenge. You have to do the 30-day launch challenge. People get amazingly great results with that. Now,
4:31:09
you also have access to Peter. He's your AI profit path coach. He's one of our AI
4:31:15
team members. Say hi to Peter. Somebody say hi, Peter, in the chat. Come on, say hi, Peter. So, what you do when you work
4:31:21
with Peter is you'll start a conversation off with Peter. You'll say hi and then you and Peter will have
4:31:27
conversations and he will tell you based on your skills and your passions what
4:31:34
your profit path is. All right. So, you'll be working with Peter. There is
4:31:39
Peter right there. He's one of our AIT team members. And you'll get access to a bunch of our different AI team members,
4:31:45
human team members, too. But I'm excited about your AI team members. So, what you're going to walk away with today is
4:31:51
you join AI Fuel Profits. You'll have your own AI income stream, a scalable
4:31:56
repeatable business framework, a complete AI marketing system, confidence using tools like ChatBT, Canva, all
4:32:03
these AI tools. Hey Genen, Vibe Coding. We do all this stuff. And then it's just
4:32:09
real world assets, not theory. So as a trainer, I like to teach with
4:32:15
demonstrations. I want to show you. I'm not going to teach you theory. I'm not going to lecture you. Let's talk about
4:32:21
the history of machine learning. If you need that, get that from somewhere else.
4:32:27
I am not going to do that because I want to show you like here's how you're going to win. Here's how it benefits you. Part
4:32:33
of that is because of all the years that I've been teaching and training. I've been an entrepreneur for 26 years. I've
4:32:40
been teaching and training for 23 of those 26 years. So, I'm not just like wake up today and teacher and trainer.
4:32:46
23 out of 26 years. By the way, I mentioned this in the beginning. This month marks 26 years. This is my 26 year
4:32:54
anniversary of being an entrepreneur. I love it. Right? I love it. I love it.
4:33:01
So, can you see how helpful this would be to have your profit path identified
4:33:07
for you to be able to build systems to get knowledge on the tools, latest and
4:33:14
greatest, right? How many people that are here feel that this would help you? Just say me in the chat. If you know
4:33:19
that this would help you, if you know this is the path that you need to lead AI fuel profits, just let me see you in
4:33:26
the chat. Give me a here in the chat. Look at you. Me. All right. I see you, Elma. Yes. Come on, Camille. Look at all
4:33:32
the exclamation marks. I love that. Martha says, "Me, myself, and I." Come on, Martha. Me, myself, and I. Come on,
4:33:40
Charlie. I see you, too. I'm looking at all of these rooms and your comments. Grace Gibson, shout out to you. I'm
4:33:47
excited to work with you, too, Grace. So, that's pretty exciting. Um, Marca
4:33:53
said, "Me and again me and again me." I love it. I love it. Yes, Anthony.
4:33:59
We'll work together. I love it. So, this helping you to identify your AI
4:34:07
income profit path and how you're going to use this sets you up for an amazing
4:34:12
future. I'm excited for you. So, here's what Latrice had to say. Let AI fill the
4:34:18
gaps. Latrice said, "I created a website, an ebook, a gamma presentation,
4:34:23
a 3D Pixar style character, and a video using Hedra." And my biggest win was
4:34:29
realizing my first gamma presentation came together in literally two months. No more sweating it out. We teach you a
4:34:35
lot because we have live trainings, boot camps, in-person events. I'm going to
4:34:40
get to that in a minute, but I want to make sure that the things that you need
4:34:46
in your business, you can create with AI and you're learning how to do all of
4:34:52
these things yourself. This is about empowering you as a business owner to be able to use artificial intelligence that
4:35:00
you can win with it. How many of you have something on your to-do list? Give
4:35:06
me just a one in the chat, right? or tell me the number like 1, five, 10. How many of you have something on your to-do
4:35:12
list that you're like, "Huh, I wonder if my AI coach can now help me get that done." Maybe it's your website. Maybe
4:35:19
it's that ebook you wanted to create. Maybe it's the podcast you want to start. Like, whatever it is, maybe it's
4:35:25
that short film you wanted to do, right? So, AI is changing so much that we have
4:35:32
to be in constant communication with you so that you can keep up to date on the latest and greatest. Yes. So, let let me
4:35:40
do that. Let me and my team keep up with the latest and greatest and come teach and coach you. That's what coaches do, right? So, let's keep going with what
4:35:47
Latrice said. Latrice said to those getting started, don't feel like you have to know everything and don't let
4:35:53
fear stop you from pulling yourself out putting yourself out there. Let AI fill in the
4:35:59
gaps and AI field profits will give you step-by-step instructions. And some of you just need the step-by-step
4:36:04
instructions, the tutorials, the community, the training. Yes. True. So,
4:36:10
right now in graduating college, I would feel like I just want you to listen to this. Let me see if I can go back. Let me go back and I just want you to listen to this
4:36:17
while I take a sip of water. Listen very closely. Right now, in graduating college, I
4:36:23
would feel like the luckiest kid in all of history. Why? Because there's never been a more amazing time to go create something
4:36:30
totally new, to go invent something, to start a company. Whatever it is, I think it is probably possible now to start a
4:36:36
company that is a oneperson company that will go on to be worth like more than a billion dollars and more importantly than that deliver an amazing product and
4:36:43
service to the world. And that that is like a crazy thing. You have access to tools that can let you do what used to
4:36:49
take teams of hundreds and you just have to like, you know, learn how to use these tools and come up
4:36:55
with a great idea. And it's quite amazing. Does anybody know who that was talking? Who was that
4:37:02
talking? Tell me in the chat. Does anybody know who was that talking?
4:37:07
The founder of Open AI, which is ChateBT, Sam Alman. What did he just say
4:37:12
there? And I want you to claim this because he said it's just going to be one person that's using AI that can now
4:37:19
act as a small team that's going to create a billion-doll business. I want somebody to say, "I claim it in the
4:37:25
chat." Say, "I claim it in the chat." So many thought leaders of our time have said that there's going to be
4:37:32
entrepreneurs, small businesses, business owners, professionals who are doing something other than their jo o,
4:37:39
right? They started their side thing that are going to be millionaires, billionaires.
4:37:44
Mark Cuban said a trillionaire because they've leaned all into AI. Why not you claim it? I claim it. You claim
4:37:51
it. I I love it. Everybody's saying I claim it in the chat. Mara, Quincy, Alberta, Erica, Melissa, Katherine,
4:37:59
Lenora. Everybody's like, "I claim it. I claim it." Consider it claimed. I love that. Consider it claimed. Claim it.
4:38:06
Claim it. Claim it. Claim it. Come on, y'all. Claim it. But I claim it in the chat.
4:38:12
But I claim it in the chat. I claim it. I claim it. How would this
4:38:18
help you and your family really leaning all into AI, learning
4:38:24
what you need to know, getting coached in AI to just change the financial
4:38:31
future of your family? What would that mean to your family? Somebody tell me in the chat, what would that mean to your
4:38:37
family, to your friends, to those you love? Bring them along. You're doing this for you and for them, right?
4:38:43
Claiming it. Abundance. I like that. Antuinette. Ah, Bar Barrett said it would change the family tree. Come on
4:38:50
now. Generational wealth. Lisa said, "How many of you are like legacy? Generational wealth. Those are the words
4:38:56
that I'm looking for." Um, Charmaine said, "Legacy and retiring my husband. You can do it." The amount of students
4:39:03
in our program that have retired and retired or quit their job because now
4:39:08
they're doing their their freedom work, their legacy work, their passion work. Legacy freedom, generational wealth. I
4:39:16
love it. Mark Cuban foresees the birth of a the first trillionaire through AI. It could just be one dude or dudet. Mark
4:39:25
dude or dudet in a basement. That's how crazy it could be. Yes, y'all claim it.
4:39:31
You're in with this. Yes, I love it. Yeah, I know. So, the reasons
4:39:37
to join AI field profits, you probably already know them, but number one is you have an amazing online portal. Let's
4:39:43
keep the learning going. Come on. an online learning portal. I know you're all in to continue learning with AI. And
4:39:50
then we have a jump start session coming up for you. So pay attention. You will get an email for your jump start
4:39:56
session. This is the session where you'll come on and we'll walk through what's inside of the course just to get
4:40:02
you started quickly quickly. All right. And then um here's people just talking
4:40:07
about the jump start session which my amazing sister Lorett does. And
4:40:13
everybody's like, I love the team members. We have training on the jump start session as well on AI teams. Super
4:40:19
helpful. Love how you teach. Thank you so much. You and your team are wonderful presenters. Very informative and
4:40:25
inspiring. Love it. Way cool. Fire and all of this there. So, you have a
4:40:31
jump start session coming up and I want to make sure that you mark it on your calendar and you are going to be at that
4:40:38
jump start session. Yes. Tuesday, January 20th, 6 PM recorded. If you can't attend live, who's going to be at
4:40:44
the jump start session just so I can see you. I know you're going to be there. Just put me in the chat. If you like the
4:40:50
way that I taught today, you're going to see that throughout the course, throughout the live sessions, throughout
4:40:55
the Inerson sessions that you'll be a part of. So, yes. Good. All right. So,
4:41:01
the jump start session is coming up. Get all in on that jump start session. Everybody says they're going to be
4:41:07
there. So, I see the chats here in the room. I'm glad you're going to be there. If you're on video right now, just give me a thumbs up. Kenneth, give me your
4:41:13
thumbs up. Let me see. Hi, Michelle C in room number three. VIP. Yes. Come on,
4:41:20
Trey. I see you. Trey is like pushing those thumbs up there. I love it. So,
4:41:26
online learning portal, the jump start session. We also have a three-day virtual boot camp which I host. It's
4:41:32
coming up soon. Make sure that you're part of that. on in those three days.
4:41:37
The day number one, it's a deep dive into your milliondoll plan. So, I have a
4:41:43
path that I walk you through with a prompt that is gamechanging. I love it. And it will create a plan for you for
4:41:49
the next 12 months for that million dollars. If you're already a million dollars, you ask it to create your $5
4:41:54
million plan. So, just be there on day number one. Again, it's recorded. If you can't be there live day number two, I
4:42:00
deep dive into vibe coding. Let's make some tools. We're gonna make some software and everybody makes it and
4:42:07
makes it for homework. We come back on day number three. Tie everything together. I can't tell you everything that happens on day number three, but
4:42:13
it's amazing. So, you have a three-day virtual boot camp. You're sitting at home just like you are now. Well, most
4:42:18
of you hopefully are at home, but I'm sitting at my computer teaching you, and it is virtual. So, this is just an
4:42:26
example of a tool someone made. People started their faceless YouTube channels.
4:42:32
They created their website. They created their software tools. This one is really cool. It has audio and it reads stories
4:42:40
to you. Crazy things that that they create. And you're creating it live and doing it for homework. Done. Done.
4:42:47
There's no like let's wait around and I don't know create your website over the next three weeks. No, you're going to do
4:42:53
it right now. Um you're going to create software tools right now. Good. There's no better time than right now. As a as
4:43:00
your AI coach and trainer, I like to say, "Let's do it together right now." How many of you like this workshop style
4:43:06
that I do? Type the prompt in. Let's go. Let's create your book cover. Yes. You like the workshop style? I like to do
4:43:11
workshop style. Yes, I like to do that workshop style. So, Cindy Ericson said, "I loved doing
4:43:18
the homework last night. I got terrific clarity on the best way to start monetizing my new business." Come on
4:43:24
now, y'all. Catchy PT gave me three options of what I could do. gave me my path to success on what I need to do for
4:43:31
the first goal I selected. Chad also told me the expected revenue for the 12-month plan.
4:43:37
And Chatty dodged dogged on me when I didn't give him requested information
4:43:43
faster. Like, we have this amazing undercover prompt that we only reveal on
4:43:48
day number one of the 3-day virtual boot camp. It'll blow your mind, but it'll give you the clarity, the monetization
4:43:54
strategy that you need. How many of you need that? Give me a money money in the chat if you need that. If that's
4:44:00
something that you know you need because I love to do that. I always like to see do people want that but I would want
4:44:06
that. So I need that. That's how I use it. Yep. All right. Money money or
4:44:12
dollar signs. Good job. I love it. Come on Claudia. Yes. Lenora. Hey Patrick.
4:44:18
What's up Patrick? VIP Patrick. I see you. Valerie said, "I'm so thankful that I met the AI queen while attending a
4:44:25
grant writing session. You're changing my life right before my eyes." Sarah said, "Let's give it up to ta team AI
4:44:31
innovation and all those working in the background. You all are amazing. Thank you for your support. These siblings are
4:44:37
changing the world." Thank you, Sarah. Uh, you're changing lives. Loren says,
4:44:42
"It does. I'm able to do things I never thought I could." So, I love that. I love that. And here we go. Thank you so
4:44:50
much for this information. This is so eye openening. Thank you for an amazing day number one and I teach you how to
4:44:57
use different tools in the boot camp. So, uh, heads up. Janice says, "I've never used Claude first time. Claude
4:45:03
seems more realistic. It gave me it and in touch as opposed to chatbt, so you
4:45:09
learn new tools as well." Cisco said, "Thank you for this boot camp. It was so valuable. It was exactly what I needed
4:45:15
to get past that stuck feeling." So, anybody that has a stuck feeling right now, I will help you get past it. Okay.
4:45:23
Um, Alpha says, "I needed this today because I was trying to figure out what I needed to focus on first. Thank you
4:45:29
for the boot camp, Alisia and Lorett." How many of you already know this program is for you? Comment me if you
4:45:35
know this program can save you time, make you a better business owner. You're
4:45:40
already like, "Me? I know this is for me. I'm so excited. You're my AI coach.
4:45:46
I know you're excited to be a part of this AI revolution. Give me a me in the chat if you're excited to be a part of this AI revolution. Barl says, "Amazing.
4:45:53
Thank you." Robert says, "Thank you very much. I'm glad I was able to participate." Now, student success, this
4:46:00
would go on forever, so I'm just going to go through some of them really quickly, but I'm excited, but more
4:46:07
importantly than that, I want your name on my student success slides. Yes, it
4:46:13
will be there. Monae says, "I created a project plan and checklist for my mother-in-law's 70th birthday party. My
4:46:20
win is that speed is my friend." Denise says, "I created a series of fun educational adventure books to help
4:46:26
children engage and learn to appreciate different traditions and cultures via adventure. The win is that I don't have
4:46:32
to wear all the hats and carry the loads. I'm not alone anymore." I'm excited for that for you. Michael said,
4:46:39
"I created a home buyer presentation using Gamma. The win is the biggest takeaway is how quick I was able to
4:46:45
create and how I can get detailed description of how to do just about anything step-by-step directions and
4:46:52
some of my when I read these I remember that we have so many people from so many
4:46:58
different industries right so Michael is in the real estate industry Denise is in
4:47:04
the education industry right we have people in every industry that you can
4:47:09
imagine yes entrepreneurs yes business owners ers. Yes, a lot of working
4:47:14
professionals. Yes, college students. Yes, a lot of people. Yes, a lot of
4:47:19

4:47:27
huge military community as well. Orion said, um, I created a welcome guide for
4:47:33
Airbnb and the win was to talk to the tool to produce the content and repeat to refine. Janice said, "I created a
4:47:40
travel website for a friend's 65th birthday trip for a group." The win was how cool it was to tell it any challenge
4:47:47
and it could add it to the website. And I remember this one because Janice felt
4:47:52
empowered, but she also felt cuz she was 65 or right about there. She said her
4:47:58
friends were so impressed what she could do with AI. I was like, "That's everything right there." Uh, Tashika said, "I started ghostwriting a book for
4:48:05
an NBA agent using Bookbot Pro. My win was it was so easy to get started. The book is really amazing and with its
4:48:11
insights and summary so far, I love it. Good.
4:48:16
Sean, I like the homework and the hands-on step-by-step process. It really made a difference for me as I'm trying to juggle jobs. So, those of you that
4:48:23
have jobs, yes, and watch some of the training even in the back room so I can be part of it. Uh, the biggest win is
4:48:29
that now I have tools to keep pushing forward. Come on, keep pushing forward everybody. Tashika, it was so easy to
4:48:35
get started. The book bot is really amazing with its insights and summaries. Demetria said, "I'm getting more
4:48:41
comfortable with using AI and it helps me with posts on social media. Coming up with a catchy title has been effortless
4:48:47
when using AI. I know that I've even tapped that I haven't even tapped into
4:48:53
everything I can do, but it's a game changer um for me since the summit. Now, one of the things I loved about Dimmitra
4:49:00
is that she's also using one of our AI agents inside the course named Vicki, who's a viral script writer for social
4:49:07
media. So, you do get some of our AI agents, AI team members. Cheryl said, "It's amazing. I spent 12 years attend
4:49:14
attending college part-time to learn a third of what I'm able to do with these tools, Canva, ChatgBT, Copilot, and
4:49:20
Gamma." Rhonda said, "I finally started something. I've been watching YouTube for over two years and never started
4:49:26
anything." I'm talking to some of you out there. Not going to name any names, but in addition, I joined over six
4:49:32
challenges, invested thousands, and never took steps to start any projects. I finally found the one. Thanks, Alicia.
4:49:38
And Lorett, it fail feels great to know that I'm forging forward. And Kenyat says, "As a graphic designer, I use
4:49:44
WordPress. It takes me two to four weeks to build out an e-commerce site. What? I
4:49:50

4:49:55
timesaver. Some of you if you could just get back your time would be so happy.
4:50:00

5:10:01
over to the site, you can go ahead and you'll see on that page, it's going to show you the stuff that you get. But you
5:10:06
get even more than that. You saw all the stuff that Alicia talked about. So, you can see that over there, but you go ahead and you fill in your information.
5:10:13
And that is step one. So, step one is when you fill in your information, and then it takes you over to step two.
5:10:19
Right. So, I'm at the fill in information page. So, you're going to fill in all your information here. Um,
5:10:25
let me fill in my information now and then put it back here. I mean, I might
5:10:31
get some presents in the mail. People saw my address, but that's okay.
5:10:36
Let me go to the next step here. You likes sushi. Send
5:10:41
like she likes Amazon and sushi. Okay. So, now now we're on this web page right here. So, on this page, it has the
5:10:49
billing info and this is how you finalize your order. So, two ways to do the payment plan. Um, number one, which
5:10:55
is the way that most people choose, is right here. So, AI fuel profits plus the AI experts club bonus 1997. You scroll
5:11:04
down to the bottom and then you are going to, let me remove my link here.
5:11:09
You're going to use CLA and CLA is a payment plan. Has anybody ever used CLA
5:11:15
before? Go ahead, Lorett. Yeah. No, I was just saying Clara is a great way. So we try to make this as easy as
5:11:21
possible for you. So we want to give you different options to allow you to pay in full and we have the buy now pay it
5:11:27
later options and the most common one is CLA. So I see a lot of people saying yes I have yes I have. So CLA allows you to
5:11:34
pay in full. So with us we see the pay in full but then you can work with them to have your billing spread out. So when
5:11:41
you click on CLA it usually says 3 to 24 months. So you can pay this off in little portions and that is an easy way
5:11:48
to do it. So CLA is definitely a great way if you want to get in right now, you can choose that CLA option. We also have
5:11:54
the PayPal pay it later. So that's another option as well. So two great options for pay it later or we also have
5:12:02
a payment plan. You have you can see there's that two pay up there at the top. So you can have that two pay plan
5:12:07
as well. But those are some different options for you in order to get you into the program because we want to make sure
5:12:13
that we give you these different options so that you can get started as soon as possible.
5:12:18
Thank you, Lorettte. Thank you. Thank you. Quite a few people are saying that they have used Clara before and that
5:12:25
it's amazing. Ma said, "I have used it and it's amazing." Lisa said, "I used it the first time with your program." So,
5:12:32
people have used it. But I just want to shout out some people here. Christopher says, "I'm in." Sharon says, "I'm in."
5:12:40
Um, Don Olsen Platinum, she said, "Invested." Woohoo. Nicole said, "It's a
5:12:46
gamechanging time. I'm trying to get through everybody that says they've invested. If I missed your name and
5:12:51
you've invested, would you just type it in one more time? Say I'm in or I've invested so I can shout you out. Nina
5:12:58
Meek, uh, platinum member, she's invested and in. Bridget Haynes. All right, Bridget, welcome. Bridget Haynes,
5:13:06
come on now. Michelle, just oh, wanted to jump in because I saw
5:13:11
this here. Mara said that she used Cara and because of she was only paying $76 a month.
5:13:16
I see that Mara. Thanks for sharing that. You're amazing. Thanks for sharing that. Great option.
5:13:22
So Tammy said pay in full didn't show up on her screen. So make sure that you
5:13:28
choose the the first option at 1997
5:13:33
if you choose this payment plan. So if you just want to do financing through us, you can choose this payment plan and
5:13:40
then you do not see the CLA option there. So because with the CLA you need
5:13:45
to have this option, the first option, the course price, and then you're going to come down and you'll even see PayPal
5:13:52
pay it later. You see cla here, you see credit card, you see afterpay, you see Google pay. Is this cash app pay here?
5:13:59
Cash app pay. Amazon, huh? Amazon pay. trying to make it as easy for everybody here. So if you want CLA,
5:14:07
you'll choose CLA right here and then you'll complete this with CLA and get
5:14:12
that information there. So and I also wanted to point out it is US only for the CLA option. So if you are
5:14:18
international, you know, you might have to change use one of the different options, right? Tammy says, "My page looks
5:14:24
different than yours. Those options to add stacks don't show up. Could you try to get on to Google Chrome, Tammy, and
5:14:31
tell me if that fixes your problem? I want to make sure that it fixes your
5:14:37
problem. Um, so Lorett Felicia says, "Oh, she was looking for another. Do you
5:14:44
have the elective option on here?" Oh, right here. So, if you need help with funding, scroll all the way down.
5:14:50
Celicia, do you see this now? Scroll all the way down to where it says it has all the card numbers and then it says need
5:14:57
help with funding. Click on that and then could you talk a little bit about elective and what this is for people
5:15:03
here, Lorett? Yeah. So again, we're giving you a lot of different options to join. So this is another option that you
5:15:09
can choose. You fill in the information and you it'll take you through that process for another option that you can
5:15:15
do as well. So, choose whichever one best fits your budget and what you can handle today so that we can get you in
5:15:21
the program as soon as possible. And you started this one because some people didn't see Clarna, right? And so,
5:15:26
you were like, "Let me get another option." And so, that's where this option came in here. Yep. Yeah. So, if you don't see Claraa, you can you
5:15:33
can go down to this option right here. So, is elective US only? Do you know
5:15:39
that, Lorett? I am not positive on that team. If you could figure that out, let me know.
5:15:45
Okay. It's elective US only. We we have that question because we do have quite a few people here um
5:15:51
internationally. So, welcome to all the internationally. Uh Pedro said it works in Canada too.
5:15:56
So, I guess Pedro has used it. So, thank you. Thank you. So, uh Kim, that would be an option for
5:16:03
you would be to use elective since Clara doesn't work there. Um elective is US and Canada. So, just got
5:16:09
confirmation. Okay. And Tammy, I don't know why these stacks don't show up for you, but we can send them to you separately. All right.
5:16:16
So, Mike says, "Elective is US and Canada." So, we have that there. Okay.
5:16:22
All right. So, let me see what question Pamela has. Um, all right, Pamela, type
5:16:30
your question into the chat so that people so that my team can answer your question as well. Okay. So on this page
5:16:37
right here, get aifueprofits.com, when you scroll down, this price right
5:16:43
here is the price of this course. If you want to split the price of the course into two, you can split it into two.
5:16:51
There's a little bit of financing charges added on when you do that, but you can pick one of those two options.
5:16:58
All right. I was just telling you that most people pick the first option so that they can use PayPal pay it later or
5:17:06
CLA and that's what I was just telling you. So making sure that you show that.
5:17:12
All right. All right. And Lorett, I want to show them something else, but did you want to say something while you're doing
5:17:18
that? No, go ahead. Show them. Show them. Okay. All right. So, let me show them
5:17:24
this real quick because then they're going to be like, "Okay."
5:17:30
All right. So, this is the website for our event that we have coming up. This is what the website is and the public
5:17:38
sees. So, it's AI Fueled Profits Live. It's in in Atlanta. That's me talking to
5:17:44
you. So, this is the website for that event. I'm excited for it. And if you
5:17:49
bought this, it would be $1,000 per person. So it would be $2,000 for two
5:17:56
people. Um, which is the same price as the course. So the tickets are basically
5:18:01
thrown in for free, which is a really good value for you. But you can imagine at the Sigma Hotel and every Signia
5:18:08
Hotel and everything that we're doing, it is quite costly to put on this event. But you get it as part of the program.
5:18:16
So do not pass on this. This is really important uh for you. So, you'll see the
5:18:21
website, don't get it on the website. You want to make sure that you're getting it through the program in the
5:18:28
package so that you're getting it at the best price. Does that make sense to everybody? I just want to make sure.
5:18:33
Let's make sure everybody's getting it at the best price and we're we're here. So, who's excited? Type excited in the
5:18:40
chat. Type excited in the chat. Yes, Mara. We will see you there, Mara. We'll
5:18:46
see you at the event. Bridget is excited. Christopher is
5:18:52
excited. Richard, Clarence, Bridget says, "See you at the event." Bridget, who are you bringing with you? I didn't
5:18:58
see who you are bringing with you.
5:19:03
And then I'm looking for um Bridget is bringing business partner. All right.
5:19:09
Perfect. Perfect. Thank you. Um All right. Perfect. Perfect.
5:19:16
So, as you're looking at AI fueled profits, if you're saying Pamela, if you're just saying, "All right, just
5:19:21
tell me what to buy." Pamela's saying, "Lorette to me, just tell me what to buy." So, here Pamela, the first choice
5:19:27
is what I would go for for you at the 1997. And then these two options right here, this is called steal my tech
5:19:34
stack. So, if you wanted if you just wanted some behind the scenes, this is like our AI blueprint of the AI tools
5:19:40
that we use. You can add this on by checking this box here. And then if you
5:19:45
want our AI cloning master class, it's just a 2hour master class from me on cloning. You can click this box right
5:19:52
here. And then they will add here's the steal my text stack. Do you see that
5:19:57
Pamela? And then here's the AI cloning masterass. So you can add that to your cart basically and then purchase. And
5:20:04
yes, Pamela, you can still purchase with CLA and do um do that as well. So,
5:20:10
Lorett, Afterpay popped up for me as an option. Does it pop up after you add those other two things? I know some
5:20:16
people would like Afterpay. I didn't see that there before. So, just showing you after I pick steal my text stack. So,
5:20:23
maybe Afterpay has a um like a minimum. Oh, there. Maybe it's there for some
5:20:28
people. Does anybody see Afterpay as well? Um Jacqueline said the link worked for her. Okay. For elective.
5:20:36
Yep. How many of you the link worked for you for elective? Could you help out Felicia? Um, and just say if it worked.
5:20:43
Just say worked in the chat. Oh, Charmaisha, you saw Afterpay. Okay, let me just let let it worked. Venus is
5:20:51
already in. Says, "I'm blown away at all the training you get when you purchase the package. This is awesome. You get 12
5:20:56
modules. That's impressive. Don't forget the 3-day boot camp. Don't forget the
5:21:01
in-person event." So, yes, Jacqueline said the link worked for me. So Felicia,
5:21:08
go back down to the bottom and click need help with funding and then you can
5:21:13
get to you should be able to get to that elective page. Try one more time because other people are saying that it works
5:21:20
that it works. All right. So Alisia, yeah, can we just real quickly kind of recap some of the things that they get?
5:21:26
So they get that hybrid training, right? So they get the online portal, right? So they can log in, work on their own with
5:21:32
that online portal. Then you have the live training that goes with it. So we know that people learn in different
5:21:38
ways. Some people like just to log in and go through things. Some people like the live interaction. So we have that
5:21:43
live interaction as well. So with the 3-day boot camp, we have that. And then remember we put in that AI experts club.
5:21:50
So the AI experts club is so important because like we said and you know the AI just moves so fast. So you have to have
5:21:57
those weekly calls. You have to have that community going saying, "Hey, look at these new tools. Hey, look how you
5:22:03
know we can do this and this just got updated, different things like that. You have to stay on top of things. So, we
5:22:10
made sure that we added you inside of the AI experts community. So, that's a big deal. And then that AI receptionist,
5:22:16
come on. Right? Somebody to answer your phones. We actually have that. We use that. We do that. If you don't have
5:22:22
something like that in your business, you are missing so many opportunities, right? So many opportunities. I know we
5:22:28
were actually looking at some data the other day on how much money is missed, how much money is left on the table when
5:22:34
you don't pick up your phone, right? When you don't pick up your phone. So, we're going to be giving you that free training on that as well. I'm going to
5:22:40
be part of that. So, you're going to see me in that onboarding session when we teach you about the AI receptionist as
5:22:47
well as that challenge that we have next week. So, when we do things, you'll notice this that when we do things, we
5:22:53
like to implement things fast. AI moves fast. We want to implement fast, right? Speed is money. So soon as you get in
5:22:59
this, when you join the AI full profits program, you will get some emails. So look out for that. You might get a few
5:23:06
emails. You're going to get emails about your onboarding, right? About your jump start session, about emails about the boot camp. You're going to get an email
5:23:13
making sure that you get registered for the AI experts club. And you're going to get an email to make sure that you sign
5:23:18
up for that GrowthHub 365 so you can get that AI receptionist. Once you get those
5:23:24
emails, sign up for them right away. We want you to take action fast, right? So, sign up right away, get yourself in
5:23:31
there, and once you sign up, then we take you to that next step. So, just making sure that you do that and you understand everything that it comes with
5:23:37
and that the live event. Now, one thing that we failed to put in that slide is
5:23:43
that yes, we have that big main event, but then the night before we actually also have a networking event. So, we put
5:23:49
something together just so you could meet the other people that are that are at the event. So, we have a networking a
5:23:55
night networking event the night before and then we have the big event that next day and you get two tickets to come to
5:24:02
that. So, that's a whole lot of training that you get for this one package price and you can use something like CLA and I
5:24:09
think it was Marsha or Mara that was paying $76 a month when she did it through CLA. So different options there
5:24:16
to get you started quickly and get you implemented as soon as possible. I love it. I love it. If you're already
5:24:22
an AI field profit and you have a question, we will answer those questions. Lorett will talk to us about
5:24:28
how to get support and answer those questions. If you want to come to a boot camp or buy something additional. So
5:24:34
Lorett, if we can get that later for support, that's good. But I just wanted to say that I'm so excited for everyone
5:24:40
who has joined today. Come on now. Let's congratulate everyone. just say congrats in the chat so that we all as a
5:24:47
community are congratulating each other for taking that step and saying I'm investing in myself. I'm going allin
5:24:53
with AI. I am going to be monetizing this AI revolution. Yes, I love it. I
5:24:59
love it. I love it. Everyone, if you've joined this session, I want to make sure that you we're going into VIP and a
5:25:06
platinum session shortly. So invest and if you're not VIP and platinum Loretta,
5:25:11
can we get those who've invested to come into the VIP session as well? Could you
5:25:16
do that? We can do that. So let's see what we can do with that. Let's see what we can do
5:25:22
with that. I just have some I have some asking. So happy for everybody who joined. So if you've invested and I haven't shouted

5:27:11
talk about that jump start session really quickly. So, that's like the orientation because I'm so excited to be
5:27:18
everyone here. I'm excited to be their AI coach. My sister Lorett is the AI coaching with us. Let me shout out
5:27:24
Lorett for a minute. All right. Yes, Lorett's amazing. Loretta is amazing. And Lorett, it took
5:27:30
me a minute to get her excited about vibe coding, but she has a background
5:27:35
where, you know, she has she has a tech background as opposed to me. But when Lorett honed in on vibe coding, which is
5:27:42
creating software and website with AI, not needing to code anything. She has
5:27:48
created tools that you will see, you will see these tools. She has created tools that are gamechanging and we love
5:27:54
them. Lorett, and I can't wait for people to see what you've created. Could you just talk about that as somebody
5:28:00
with a tech background like talk about what how gamechanging today is the times that we're in?
5:28:05
Yeah, so I do have a a tech background. I was computer science and stuff like that. If you guys can relate, you
5:28:10
probably know like Dreamweaver, Front Page. I did like C C++ all that kind of stuff. Um, if you guys would know that,
5:28:18
but times have definitely changed. Wow. how you can create a website and have
5:28:24
something amazing in just a few days is unbelievable. And that's something that
5:28:29
we're going to be teaching you in that three-day boot camp. I have gone down a rabbit hole. I'm like I'm on my laptop
5:28:36
passed out because I just can't stop. My kids are shaking on my shoulder like, "Mom, you fell asleep." Because I'm there bu I can't stop because I'm
5:28:43
building these amazing tools. I'm building these amazing websites. But a lot of these tools that I'm building are solving problems. So, for example, you
5:28:51
know, we have an, you know, something that was taking our team way too long to do. So, I said, you know what? I'm going
5:28:56
to build an app for that. So, now we build an app, we save time, we're saving money, and we're making money from it as
5:29:02
well. So, we're going to teach you how to create these apps, how to create these websites in record time. And you
5:29:08
don't have to have a technical background, even though I have a slightly technical background, but you don't have to. As long as you understand
5:29:16
what you want your tool to do, what you want the end result to be, you can create these in record time, you will be
5:29:23
so proud of yourself. And if anybody has done VI coding already, like if you're using some of these tools, I know you
5:29:29
can agree with me in the chat that it is amazing and it will be empowering and you'll be able to not only do stuff for
5:29:35
yourself, but you can also charge people for these tools and these sites that you're going to be creating. So very
5:29:41
excited about that and excited to show you some of the things that we've created as well. So look forward to that
5:29:46
on that 3-day boot camp because we do do a deep dive into vibe coding and you're
5:29:52
going to have some amazing results from that. I love it. I love it. Thank you, Lorettte. Terrence invested. Pamela
5:29:58
Daniels invested. Terrence Sweeting, I see you both of you platinum sending me messages. Lorett, I cannot keep up with
5:30:05
all the I've invested messages, but I'm trying to shout everybody out. If I didn't shout you out, type it in the
5:30:11
chat one more time. Let me try to get let me try to get to you so that I don't miss you. If I did not shout you out, I
5:30:17
want to shout you out, acknowledge you, see who you are. And so VIPs, get ready.
5:30:23
Stay in this room. We're going to do a hot seat coaching and vibe coding. So VIPs, hang on for a minute. I know
5:30:31
Michael will tell us where to go, but I want VIPs to to stick around here. And
5:30:36
if you haven't upgraded to VIP and you waited till now, it's okay. It's okay. Do that right now because we have our
5:30:43
hot seat session coming up. I've got a training on vibe coding coming up. I'm going to talk about how I monetize AI as
5:30:50
an AI consultant. Some of the things that I do as an AI consultant. So, some behind closed doors things in the
5:30:56
private VIP platinum room. So, yes, look at everybody who says they're excited.
5:31:02
Um, I love that. I love it. and Rosalyn invested. Tammy Rosalyn Williams, thank
5:31:09
you so much. Tammy Martin, I see you. I see you. Yes. Yes. Mara said, "I've
5:31:15
created the I'm creating the most incredible tools and I didn't have any tech experience before November." So,
5:31:21
Lorett, also tell us, we have some members here who have joined AI Fuel Profits in the past. They're saying it's
5:31:26
the best investment ever and now they're saying, "Oh, I'm going to come to the event." What do they need to do? Where
5:31:32
do they need to email you? Yeah. So, we just have that support. But if you are already part of AI Fuel
5:31:38
Profits, not to worry. You're going to get emails. I know you've received many emails from us, emails, text messages,
5:31:43
you're going to get all that communication. So, not to worry, you are invited to the live event. And remember,
5:31:49
you get two tickets. So, if you missed the last one, you could definitely come to the one that is coming up. And more
5:31:55
information coming soon. But just know that if you are in the program, you are guaranteed a spot to attend the live
5:32:01
event. I love it. I love it. I just want to also shout out in the VIP session, we
5:32:06
have one of the um MC's that MC's the live event. She is going to help me and
5:32:12
she's going to host the VIP platinum session that's coming out. So, I just want to shout out Nenah. Nah's amazing.
5:32:18
And can I tell you that woman has really gone allin with AI, but not just for herself. She has pulled her daughter
5:32:25
Paige in as well. And Paige is doing amazing things with AI. I hope Nina will
5:32:30
spend some time and tell us about what she and Paige have been doing. But she is so amazing. I just want to give her a
5:32:37
shout out really quickly. And I want to encourage all of you too. Pull your kids into this. Pull your family into this.
5:32:44
This is an amazing time to be here. Lorett, people were commenting and saying, "Oh, I used to do Dreamweaver
5:32:50
and Front Page." Like they know the struggle and the struggle is real. And I think that's why Lorett and I appreciate
5:32:57
AI so much. Listen, we have had to hire the copywriters and pay them. Hire the
5:33:04
developers, not get the project done. How many projects do we have sitting on the shelf because we couldn't finish it
5:33:10
with a developer? But once we're using AI, I don't need you anymore. I can do it myself. I am
5:33:16
a lot of money saved. Say it again. A lot of a lot of money saved. A lot of money saved. I am the farthest
5:33:21
person from being a developer. But the tools that I have created I love. I'm so proud of so many people are using. So
5:33:27
it's been an amazing journey. So if you have been a business owner for some
5:33:33
years, somebody type years in the chat. If you've been a business owner for some years or an entrepreneur or getting your
5:33:38
side hustle on, you will appreciate this so much because you have gone through it
5:33:45
and now you're saying, "Wait a second." Because we have a press release AI agent that you'll use. You'll be like, "I just
5:33:52
did my press release in 5 minutes and didn't have to pay $4.97 to PR company.
5:33:58
What is going on here? Wait a second. I just wrote all the emails that I need for my business in two minutes." And
5:34:05
when you say I, that means me and AI. That's like the combination. So you say,
5:34:11
"Oh, I just wrote this for you
5:34:17
tools. We'll go over this in the VIP session. You should not charge less than 7,500. If you're building a website,
5:34:24
3,500 for a landing page, right? So, we're you're charging a good amount to create
5:34:31
these things. But to a company, that's nothing. That's that's nothing. 7,500 to
5:34:37
get a software created, you're almost too cheap. You're almost too cheap. They're they're expecting to pay 30,000
5:34:44
100,000. Most of the tools we've ever developed Lorett 10,000 30,000 to get them developed and Lorett's like and
5:34:50
they're still sh sitting on the shelf because we're not happy with them. But when last one that we did was 34,000 and it's
5:34:56
not launched and I don't think we're going to launch it cuz I created something better with the five coding by
5:35:01
myself in a few days. Come on now. Come on. And and this is the thing. It's like in a few days. And
5:35:08
that was like a project that a team had been working on for a year. Look at Lorett's face. people,
5:35:15
right? But now with artificial intelligence, come on y'all. Take take what you are learning in AI fueled
5:35:22
profits and go. This is your time to cash in. This is your time to be early
5:35:29
in the AI revolution and take it and run with it. Go learn this information and
5:35:35
be I'm excited for you. Like I'm really excited as your AI coach. I'm excited for you. I cannot wait to see what you
5:35:41
create. I cannot wait to see what you build. But most importantly, I cannot wait to see how you grow, expand, and
5:35:47
multiply your profits, your business, your brand, everything with artificial
5:35:53
intelligence. Who's excited about just saving time with AI? Give me a T in the
5:35:58
chat for the saving of time. The time that it takes to get things done. Boom.
5:36:04
It's like we're in a part of history right now that's called the no excuses
5:36:10
part of history. when you go allin with AI. Look at everybody that's excited about saving time.
5:36:17
Um C Wade said, "I'm basically a trailblazer for the amount of years I've been an entrepreneur. I needed this to
5:36:23
move efficiently and maximize my time, energy, and talent. This is how you can multiply your talent." You know, Allison
5:36:30
said, "Allin is right." Chené said, "For real." So, welcome everybody. I'm excited for everybody who is joining us
5:36:38
today. Yes, everybody joining us today. Look at everybody here. All right, let me go
5:36:43
back to the chat. If I missed you saying you invested, type it in the chat again. Let me give you a shout out. Save time,
5:36:52
be more efficient, be more productive. Lorett, I'll also say I love this because it's helped me and the ones that
5:36:59
we teach to take their passions and turn it into impact, turn their passions into
5:37:04
profits. So, you have that idea. Someone here, I'm talking to you right now.
5:37:09
Someone here has an idea that you know will make you a ton of money. You know
5:37:14
will make impact in the world but you didn't have either the tools or the resources or the team to push that out
5:37:22
but now you do. Who who here am I thinking about? Just type me in the chat
5:37:28
if you're like, "Yes, I have an idea. I have an impact project, but I just didn't have the tools, resources, or
5:37:34
team, but now I can get that through AI fueled profits because there's so many of you that are sitting on gold mines
5:37:43
that are sitting in day one of the boot camp. Actually, I have AI help you to pull out what that is." So also Peter
5:37:50
helps to do that but I help you to pull that out so that you can really understand what you already have that
5:37:57
you can monetize. Some people don't know it, they don't see it, but you'll answer a series of questions and AI will help
5:38:03
you boom be able to see what that is and to push that out. So Fred said, "I have
5:38:10
many ideas for impact." Um Alikumar says, "Yes, I have that." That's me. I'm
5:38:16
talking about you, right? Marla said, "Literally gold mines." Gold mines you
5:38:21
have. Um, I love that. Tanal says, "Yes, I have ideas." Right. So, um, Tat Anna
5:38:30
says, "I have many that are going to be worlds changing. I'm so excited to see what you have and to help you build it."
5:38:39
Uh, let's see. Barry says, "I'm glad to be here. Great information." Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I love it. I love
5:38:45
it. I love it. So, welcome everybody to AI Fueled Profits. And um let me just
5:38:51
mention Clara one more time because I see that question keep popping up and those of you that are sending me private
5:38:57
messages, I see you. Instead of answering them one by one, let me just go back to the CLA page and then I need
5:39:04
to head on over to the VIP session. So, look here on the this page. Um when
5:39:10
you're on this page with the billing info, I think this is the confusion. Press the first button. The first button
5:39:17
that says AI field profits AI experts club. Renee, shout out to Renee. Renee
5:39:23
says, "I've invested." And then scroll down here and this is where you want to pick CLA

5:39:36
you can choose a card. Google Pay, Amazon Pay, Cash App Pay, PayPal, PayPal
5:39:41

5:39:48
"Me, too." I'm in. I'm in. All right. Denise, you're not seeing it on your
5:39:54
computer. And you're looking on Chrome. I'll see how we can get the team to
5:40:00
Bernardet. Glad that you're here. Yes. Yes. Yes. Part of AI Fuel Profits. Um,
5:40:05
all right. Perfect. So, Lorett and Michael, take us into the next session.
5:40:11
and tell the VIPs what they should do if you're not VIP yet. How to grab it. You
5:40:16
should be VIP by by now, but how to grab it. So, we're about to move into the hot seat session, and I'm excited for that.
5:40:22
All right. Thank you so much, Alisia. Everybody give Alicia a big round of applause, y'all. Big round of applause
5:40:28
for Alicia. Man, going in three straight segments is not for the faint of heart. And so, if you learned something new
5:40:35
today, just go ahead and let me know in the chat. Let me know in the chat if you learned something new. So VIP and
5:40:40
platinum, we're going to go over, we're going to allow you in just a few minutes. You're going to stay where you're at, but you're going to go into a
5:40:47
hot seat coaching. Okay? So that means you can go in there. We're going to allow you to ask some questions from
5:40:53
Alisia. We have maybe some guests coming in the room for you. So, if you're here and you're on YouTube and you haven't
5:40:59
upgraded to VIP and platinum yet, you can go to aibusinesssummit.comupgrade
5:41:07
aibusiness.com/upgrade to get your VIP and platinum ticket. Um, so VIP and Platinum, just so you know,
5:41:14
you're going to actually stay in the same exact room. You're not going to move. You're not even going to have to go anywhere, which is great. So, we're
5:41:20
just going to come to you and Miss Nina Moore is going to be in the room introducing you all very momentarily.
5:41:26
And actually team, we can go ahead and pass it over to Nina if we want. Me and Lorett, we're going to stay here with
5:41:31
everybody on YouTube and we just want to answer some questions. We want to spend some time with you all here giving you
5:41:37
the ultimate clarity, right? We want to just make sure that you have everything you need to win with this this
5:41:43
opportunity with AI fueled profits. Is it okay? Do you guys give me permission? We have thousands people still watching
5:41:49
on YouTube, on Facebook. And do you all give me permission to just take a few minutes to a answer your most frequently
5:41:55
asked questions just to break this down deeper because I want to make sure that you have the most confidence and clarity
5:42:01
to make a decision today to jump in. Is that okay with you all? Okay, I see uh I see y'all in the chat saying yes. I love
5:42:07
it. I love it. Okay, so real quick, Lorett, a lot of people are
5:42:13
asking, "Hey, where do I upgrade to VIPM Platinum? How do I get in the other room?" So after you purchase VIP and
5:42:20
platinum, we did have a big influx of people jumping in. So emails and texts
5:42:25
are taking a little longer than expected to send to you. So if you did purchase VIP and Platinum, um it it takes about
5:42:32
10 minutes to get 5 to 10 minutes to get your uh you know, email, text, and everything in your inbox, but you should
5:42:38
have it within 5 to 10 minutes. Check your spam, your junk folder. They have so many promotion folders nowadays. I
5:42:44
don't even know all of them. There's like a million of them. So, just go in there, check every folder, just double
5:42:49
check there. If you still can't find it, you can message our support team. I I think the link for that is a business.com/support
5:42:56
if you need help. But, uh, yeah, just check your email, check your text because you'll get the link there. Now, all everything's recorded. So, if you're
5:43:03
a little late into the VIP and platinum session, it's all good. It's all recorded. Uh, we're actually Nah's going
5:43:08
to get the room started over there. Alicia is going to take a little break. So, you're not in a rush, okay? Like, don't don't feel pressured and rushed to
5:43:15
go right now. But just know that any purchases you make today, just give us 5 to 10 minutes to get you your
5:43:21
confirmation email. And that's the same with AI Fueled Profits. For those of you all that are still working on AI Fueled
5:43:26
Profits, just comment working on it in the chat. Let me know. But just so you all know that is um you know that could
5:43:33
take a couple minutes as well to land in your inbox. Okay. But real quick, while y'all are dropping working on it in the chat, I'm going to shout out a few
5:43:38
individuals who just got into AI fuel profits and then I'm going to answer some questions. I know Miss Lorett is
5:43:45
not feeling the best, so I'm going to try to try to take the bulk of this. I may pass her one or two questions. Um,
5:43:50
but I'm going to give a shout out to Chris Beard who just jumped in. Everybody put congratulations in the chat. I want to shout out, let me see
5:43:57
real quick. We have All right, Tamara is working on it. Shout out to you, Tamara, for working on it. Eric's working on
5:44:04
jumping in. Let's go. Uh, shout out to Tiffany's for working on it. Let's go. I I love it. I love it. Uh, is it Cleo
5:44:11
just got in. Shout out to Cleo for investing. So, go to getifueprofits.com
5:44:18
to jump into the program. But I want to walk you all through one more time. Team, is it okay if I just share my
5:44:23
screen real quick? So, I want to walk them through very slowly what's inside of this program because I I don't think
5:44:29
they truly see the value in this. So, I'm going to go ahead and share my screen real quick. And this is what we're going to do. We're going to walk
5:44:35
through this together. I want to walk you through exactly everything you're going to get in AI Fueled Profits. And then Lorett, I may have you chime in
5:44:41
occasionally. I may say, "Hey, Lorett, tell them about this." So, just kind of hang tight, but um let's go ahead and do this. I'm going to share my screen right
5:44:47
now and uh let's go into it. So, this is the AI fueled profit. You all,
5:44:52
this is a self-paced curriculum you can jump into to get support on creating an
5:44:58
AI income. Now, we're not in here. I'm not making any claims that you're going to go make a million dollars in 30 days.
5:45:04
We we can't guarantee you're going to make money because we don't know the action you're going to take. All we can do is give you the information, right?
5:45:10
But this is a learn at your own pace curriculum where you can come in and we're going to help you identify an AI
5:45:17
profit path. We call you uh we call it and we're going to help you identify what that is and you're going to get to
5:45:22
go through the pro and then our goal is that you start generating income sometime in the next 30 to 60 days with
5:45:28
that path. We have some people that do it sooner, but again, we can't guarantee results, but that's that's the goal of
5:45:33
it. Our goal is that we're going to accelerate results through our curriculum and the live trainings that we're going to do inside of AI Fueled
5:45:40
Profits. Now, in here, you'll see there these are some of the modules we have. Number one, we're going to take you
5:45:46
through um choosing your profit path with Peter. We already told you about Peter a little bit ago. He's going to actually coach you through all the
5:45:52
different ways to make revenue with um AI, right? So, we have freelancing
5:45:57
opportunities, AI powered digital digital products. Y'all, I'm knocking over stuff over here. AI AI power
5:46:04
digital products. We're gonna show you faceless YouTube. Like there's so many ways you can go and create income with
5:46:10
AI you all. And I'm actually Is it okay? Everybody on on YouTube watching, is it okay if I show you all in just a few
5:46:16
minutes how I went and I've made some money myself with AI? Is it okay with you all? Let me know in the chat. I'm
5:46:22
going to show you one unique way that I feel like is in high demand and that will allow you to go create like just
5:46:28
it's just another way that you can go actually create sales for other businesses and get paid from it. So, just hang tight and I'm going to show
5:46:33
you at the at the very end. But, so we're going to show you not only how to pick your profit path, but we're going to train you on each of those. And so,
5:46:39
I'm going to uh show you the next slide here where we're going to show you not only how to build your business and build that um income path, but guess
5:46:46
what? We're going to show you how to build a business around it, right? how to market it, how to attract customers,
5:46:52
how to build your own systems for your own business. Now, we have some people here and you're like, "Hey, will this
5:46:58
work if I already have a business and I want to go ahead and I just want to, you know, use AI in my business?" The answer
5:47:04
is yes. I'll let Lorettte talk about that in just a few minutes, but yes, even if you already have a business, we're going to help you implement AI
5:47:11
into that existing business, right? Because we have um you know, showing you how to build custom GPTs. We do a 30-day
5:47:17
launch challenge. There's so much in store um when you jump in. So, this is
5:47:22
the first thing we want you to do when you jump in. So, those of you all that are getting into the AI field profits today, we want you to go jump into the
5:47:28
curriculum after you're given access and go talk to Peter, the AI profit coach. We want you to go in there because he's
5:47:35
going to help you identify which path is for you. Now, if you already know your path and you already have a business, that's cool. But this is really for
5:47:41
those individuals that are like, "Hey, I want to create a new AI business and I want to find a way to generate revenue with it." He'll walk you through based
5:47:47
upon your personality, your preferences, based upon everything he knows about you. He's going to tell you, "Hey, this
5:47:52
is what you should do, right?" He's going to ask you what excites you more. Do you want a little bit more passive income or do you want to be a little bit
5:47:58
more active in your business? Hey, do you want to sell digital products or do you want to do stuff in person? Right? Do you want to work with local
5:48:04
businesses or online businesses? He's going to ask you a lot of different things. Hey, how much time do you want to put into it in a day? And then you
5:48:11
get to choose and he's going to give you, you know, recommendations. You get to go from there. So by the end of this,
5:48:16
the goal is that you'll walk away with a scalable, repeatable business framework. Our goal is that you actually have a
5:48:21
framework to go off of a complete marketing system on how to, you know, market that new business, but then not
5:48:27
on top of that, um, you know, really just have the confidence to use those tools. And so this is where, uh, Lorett,
5:48:32
I'll pass it over to you. You know, we're not just giving them a system, helping them pick their path, but we're
5:48:37
going to show you how to use all these tools and get confident. And these are just the this is just the tip of the
5:48:43
iceberg. Chat GBT, Canva, um, Hey Jen, these are all just, you know, the tip of the iceberg. There's many, many more
5:48:49
tools. So, talk about it for existing business owners. Lorett, talk about how we equip them and what we do to make
5:48:55
sure that they get all the resources and to get trained on all these softwares. Yeah. So, as an existing business owner,
5:49:03
Oh, you hear me? Okay. Yeah. As an existing business owner, it's really important to understand which tool fits
5:49:09
with your business because there's lots of different tools out there. There's hundreds of different tools that come up all the time with AI, but we're going to
5:49:16
show you which ones that you should be using in your business. And one thing that we do is that we actually do the
5:49:22
hands-on demonstrations. So, we show you and we teach you say, "Hey, if you want
5:49:27
to make if you want to write emails, this is the tool that you need to use and this is how you use it. If you want
5:49:32
to make a video clone, this is the tool that you need to use and this is how you use it." So, just like Alisi was
5:49:38
teaching today, we do all the hands-on stuff that comes with it. So, it's all workshop style. And then the 3-day boot
5:49:44
camp is where you're going to actually do it hands-on. We give you homework.
5:49:49
Yes, homework. Just like you're in school, but we give you homework. And we expect the next day to show us what you
5:49:56
got done. So, we are going to give you homework. And then the next day, we say, "Hey, show us what you did." And then you have to show it. We bring you up.
5:50:03
You demonstrate things. We help work through any problems that you've made have had with your homework. And then
5:50:09
you showcase it. And then we have homework again. Then we bring it all together on day three. So, it's a very
5:50:14
active, engaging process in addition to the online portal as well. I love how
5:50:21
Michael talked about Peter. Peter is fantastic. Peter's going to give you the clarity. If you saw some of those um
5:50:28
testimonials, the feedback that Alicia shared, a lot of them talked about clarity. Now, I know that's something
5:50:34
that a lot of people struggle with because we work with people all the time is you're confused on what direction to
5:50:40
take. So, for example, Alicia was teaching today, hey, do this. Hey, you can do this. Hey, you can do this. But
5:50:46
how does it all come together as a business? How do you put that together to monetize it? How do you use that to
5:50:52
actually make some money or make, you know, earn an income from your efforts? Maybe it's new or revamping what you
5:50:59
currently have. And that's what this is all about to give you that clarity and to give you that road mapap on what to
5:51:05
do from an idea to implementation. So that's the whole goal of this program.
5:51:11
And we have a whole section inside of the portal that has tools as well. So we have the different tools in there to
5:51:17
help guide you through this process. So it's more than just, hey, look at this cool thing that I did, but how can you
5:51:24
build a business around it? That's what we focus on inside of this training.
5:51:30
Thank you so much. Thank you so much, Lorett. We appreciate you. And I actually seen while while you were
5:51:36
typing that, I seen a couple or while you were talking about that, I saw a few people typing in the chat, hey, like when do we get started though? Like if
5:51:41
we jump in, do we had like wait or like when do we get in? So, I do want to let you all know that we can start. You
5:51:46
start immediately, right? And but we also have some sessions jumping in. So, I'm going to I'm going to show you on this slide right here. We have a jump
5:51:53
start session. We have a jump start session starting um very soon. And it's actually on January 20th. Let me go back
5:52:00
here. January 20th. But we also have tonight we have a lounge. And just so you all know, tonight um and Friday
5:52:07
night, we have a lounge where you can actually go in and just ask questions from our coaches and from some of our
5:52:13
team members if you need help. Um you know, maybe you jumped in, you're like, "Hey, I don't understand how to work the portal." Or maybe you just want to meet
5:52:19
some families. So tonight, um you know, just check your email after you purchase. There should be information in there on how to join it. but we're doing
5:52:26
a lounge, more of like a a gentle onboarding call just for those of you all that are purchasing. So, that'll be
5:52:32
each evening tonight and Friday for those of you all that, you know, need a little bit more support. And so, real
5:52:37
quick, while I'm uh letting you all jump in, I just want to give a shout out to a few individuals who are working on it and who have also gotten in real quick.
5:52:44
Uh we have Jacqueline's working on it. Lynn's working on it. I love it. Selena is working on it. Amazing. And amazing.
5:52:51
We have Ellie uh is working on it. Shout out to OA who just jumped in. Congratulations. Let's see. We have Lynn
5:52:58
is working on it. All right. All right. Shout out to Tanja for jumping in. I love it. So, real quick, I'm going to
5:53:05
take you through. So, not only do we have the jump uh jump start session, but we also have the lounge happening
5:53:11
tonight and Friday night. So, you get uh you can jump in whatever. So, you all you're not only getting access to the portal with all the curriculum with the
5:53:18
Peter and the custom GPTs and all that inside of it. We're gonna give you a jump start session and the private
5:53:24
lounge tonight, but then on top of that, three-day virtual boot camp. And this is one of my favorites because people leave
5:53:30
this boot camp with so many wins. Uh, and this is like really where you kind of start learning in the curriculum
5:53:36
right away, but then you go get deeper help and deeper support on this 3-day event, right? And so, um, this is really
5:53:43
you could see Sarah. Sarah's actually, you know, kind of helping us on our team now. It's really cool how it started out. But Sarah, you know, she shared her
5:53:50
win. You can go through. Valerie said, you know, this was awesome. You can see Cindy said, "This was awesome." All
5:53:55

5:55:16
of the portal as well. So, you won't miss anything. Uh everything's always recorded, but you're always going to get
5:55:22
invited to the next sessions that we have. So, you'll keep up on that learning ongoing.
5:55:28
Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Shout out to Brandon who just jumped into AI Fueled Profits. Donna is working
5:55:34
on it. Shout out to Donna uh ahead of time. All right. So, I want to go in. We have other special bonuses, y'all. So,
5:55:40
not only do you get the curriculum and the jump start sessions and you get all these amazing things, but we also have
5:55:46
the AI experts club. And so, this is really cool because we bring a lot of guests into AI experts club. We're
5:55:51
actually planning out 2026, a lot of a lot of the guest speakers right now for you all, but this is like where you can
5:55:58
stay on top of all things AI even deeper, right? Just another community added on inside of school where you can
5:56:04
jump in and network um with each other. It's really really cool with some additional mini trainings inside of
5:56:09
there. Um, so somebody did ask a question. Hey, is there a monthly fee for this? So, it's 90 days free and then
5:56:16
after if you don't want to continue on, hey, no harm, no foul. You can you can continue on if you'd love to. We'd love
5:56:22
to have you in there for as long as possible. But if you're like, hey, after 90 days I'm cool. Hey, no harm, no foul.
5:56:28
Go ahead and you can cancel. There's no contracts, nothing holding you saying you have to stay in there forever. Okay,
5:56:33
so just letting you know about that. Um, so the next that's the first bonus, AI experts club, but the second bonus is
5:56:40
Nano Banana Crash Course. All right, imprompt Generator. Um, I know for you all, listen, I've been using Gemini.
5:56:48
I've been using chat GBT for images all the time. Actually, the team, Lorett, the team just told me they were like, "Oh, we got this image, but something's
5:56:55
messed up on it. Can can you go and can can we fix this and send it to the graphic designer?" I said, "The graphic
5:57:00
designers clocked out." I said, "They they ain't coming back. They clocked out. They're off the clock." And uh she
5:57:05
she said, "Oh, I got an idea. What if I could just put this into, you know, AI and it can uh you know, fix the image
5:57:11
for me?" And I said, "Sure, try it. I I don't know if that'll work. I'm guessing so." And uh we put into Google Gemini
5:57:17
and it literally fixed exactly what we needed. We did I love my graphic designers, but it didn't need they
5:57:24
didn't need them. They were off and we were able to save the day. So, uh, you know, just on top of the portal that
5:57:29
you're going to get, the jump start session and the onboarding call, the 3-day virtual boot camp, the 90 days of
5:57:35
AI experts club, and the nano banana nano banana crash course. Listen y'all, that's it's crazy because listen, that's
5:57:41
that alone is a business opportunity there. You go and you go, you know, be become uh a part-time very very
5:57:48
part-time graphic designer. Uh, you can actually go and create really great graphics with uh Google Gemini. actually
5:57:55
uh one of my friends actually had something he wanted um you know images created for uh a big promotion he's
5:58:01
doing and I said oh okay let me just see if Google Gemini will do this. I went in and literally within probably five
5:58:06
minutes which would have took me hours five minutes I had like 10 ads created
5:58:12
that he and he went and ran you know ads with it and I was like oh that was cool like that would have took a graphic designer all day or two days to do right
5:58:19
and so I just love that that's so valuable. So team, let's go back to this slide. I just want them to see the websites where they can go. You go to
5:58:25
get aifueprofits.com. And I also wanted to add on that nano banana thing. So we actually have some
5:58:31
of our students who are doing AI photooots. So if you saw that picture that was on the screen, Alicia was in
5:58:37
her business suit. And so we've had people do like business photo shoots for people.
5:58:44
That's an example. And we give you the prompts on how to do something like that. So they're charging people saying,
5:58:49
"Hey, we can do a business photo shoot for you and they're using Nano Banana." They've done ones, we had several
5:58:54
students that were doing ones for the holidays, like we'll do a whole holiday photo shoot of you or we'll do, you
5:59:00
know, family photo shoots and so forth. So that's another way that you can use tools like this and monetize it and
5:59:06
actually turn it into a business. So, uh, doing AI photo shoots for people and we teach you about that as well.
5:59:12
Yeah, for sure. Thank you so much, Lorett. Thank you so much. So you all the look, just check this out. I want
5:59:17
you to take a screenshot of this because the last thing I want you to do, Lorett, and last thing I want them to do is uh to go home from here, go to bed, and
5:59:26
they're like, "What is that site again? What is that site?" Listen, team, you just take me off the screen for a
5:59:32
second. I just want everybody to screenshot this. Screenshot this. Save it. Get aifueledprofits.com
5:59:39
because I last thing I wanted tonight, you saying, "Man, I wish I would have saved that link. I wish I would have clicked on it." Go ahead and save that
5:59:46
and go on to the site. Now, we always want to overd deliver. So, AI receptionist, you I'm not going to go
5:59:52
too deep into this because you saw this demonstrated live today. You saw how powerful AI receptionist can be for you.
6:00:00
Especially for those of you all that you're super busy, you don't have time to be on the phones all day. Imagine be
6:00:05
able to get that inside of GrowthHub where you can go sell that and use that
6:00:10
those templates we have for you pre-built for you. GrowthHub alone, y'all, this is crazy super valuable. And
6:00:17
I wanna I want toh show this real quick. You get 30 days access complimentary
6:00:22
just for being in AI fueled profits. That means you get AI fueled profits.
6:00:27
Say you get 30 days, you don't have to pay. You get in, you can actually start using the machine.
6:00:33
And our goal is that maybe you go start trying to create an income with it. But then on top of that, guess what? We know
6:00:39
everybody's a little bit different with software. Everybody's a little bit, you know, um, at different places with tech,
6:00:45
right? So, the team said, "You know what? We're not just going to give them the Growth Hub platform, but on top of
6:00:52
that, guess what we're going to do? We're going to host a private event next week. A private event next week where
6:00:59
they just go through and we'll show them exactly how to use the platform, how to start maybe using that AI receptionist,
6:01:05
how to actually go start generating revenue with it." Who's excited about that? put me in the chat if you're excited to be on the GrowthHub challenge
6:01:12
where our team personally is going to sit down with you and show you how to use the platform and get you running fast. So yo, I want you to think about
6:01:19
it. You got the jump start session, you have the onboarding calls tonight, you have the boot camp, you got the growth
6:01:25
hub challenge. We're like throwing in four tickets. That's not even counting the conference. That's crazy. But then
6:01:31
on top of that, you know, you get the private GrowthHub community, the weekly trainings we do. This is I want you all to understand GrowthHub is an entire CRM
6:01:40
for your business. Now, if you don't know what CRM is, it's a customer relationship management tool.
6:01:48
GrowthHub is a place where you can go build websites, you can go send emails, you can send texts, you can do all these
6:01:54
things within one location. I don't know about you all, but in my business, I got a lot of I got a lot a lot of software
6:02:00
fees. Probably a thousand plus dollars in software fees. But imagine if you
6:02:05
could take those hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars you're paying and condense it to one platform where you can send texts and emails from one
6:02:11
place. You could build websites. You can do AI receptionist from one place. Yo,
6:02:16
that's wild. That's wild. So, GrowthHub, make sure after you purchase, one thing I want to say is you have to go claim
6:02:22
that trial ASAP or I think it's going to expire, the team said. So, after you go and in your confirmation email and
6:02:29
confirmation text, there's going to be um a message where you go in there and click a link to claim the trial. I want
6:02:35
you to do that ASAP so you can get into the community and so you can get prepared for the challenge next week
6:02:41
ahead of time. Okay, that would be my recommendations for you. That would be my recommendation for you
6:02:46
all. Okay, so listen, GrowthHub is amazing bonus that you get. So, not only
6:02:52
do you get the online portal, the jump start session with the onboarding, the 3-day virtual boot camp, the 90 days of
6:02:57
AI experts club, the nano banana crash course, the AI receptionist with growth
6:03:03
hub and everything else it does. Y'all, AI fuel profits live. I was there. This
6:03:09
was amazing. This is actually my first time meeting Lorett in person. I don't know about you guys. You want to meet Lorett and Alisia in person. I I I just
6:03:17
love being around their energy. They're so amazing. But when you come in, you get a ticket. Not just one ticket, but
6:03:23
two tickets. Y'all, that is bananas in itself because people charge hundreds of
6:03:30
dollars to come to these conferences. But the fact that you get two free tickets to come in and this isn't like a conference where there's 200 people,
6:03:36
like a 100 people. No, you're looking at like one, two, three, people in a room talking about AI. So, I'm I'm excited
6:03:44
for that because that event alone has brought a lot of, you know, relationships for people that enter the
6:03:49
room, a lot of business partnerships, a lot of new epiphies, ideas from the
6:03:55
teachers and the and the uh trainers that are in the room. So, you definitely want to go ahead and put that in the books along with the networking night
6:04:01
the night before February 20th. So, February 20th and the 21st, make sure you are in the room. All right, so uh
6:04:08
let's go on. So, not only do you get the online learning portal, the jump start session, the virtual boot camp, the 90
6:04:14
days of AI experts club. Y'all, this is wild. Nano banana crash course, AI receptionist, and two free tickets to AI
6:04:20
fuel profits live. Y'all, this should be this should be crazy crazy priced at, you know, way more than it is. Um,
6:04:26
you're probably thinking it's 9997, should be priced at $4997. Y'all listen, this will go up. Let me say this. I
6:04:32
don't think Alicia said this. The price will go up this Sunday at midnight
6:04:40
Pacific Standard Time. So everybody everybody put understood in the chat. Price will go up. It will not
6:04:47
be at this price forever. I I I wish it could, but we just can't. So y'all today, this is the this is the summit
6:04:54
only pricing is $19.97 or you could do two payments of I
6:05:00
believe it's $10.97. Okay. So everything you get here, you've seen it all, right?
6:05:05
It's so so valuable for 1997. It will go up Sunday night at midnight Pacific
6:05:11
Standard Time. So, uh, this is what I want to do. I'm going to actually show you the website. I want to show you where how to go take action on this. So,
6:05:18
you guys can go, um, on the website. Let me actually team, can we stop sharing screen so I can actually, uh, clear my
6:05:25
information out. Thank you so much. So, all you're going to do is you're going to go into step one here. All right. Now
6:05:31
we can go back team. Thank you so much. All right. So you're going to go in here and you can go right here at the top and
6:05:37
you're just going to fill out your contact information on step one. Now you need to put your full name, an email,
6:05:42
your phone number. Just make sure everything's correct. And then when you go to step two, you're going to go here and you can choose between
6:05:49
paying in full 1997 or you can do two payments of 107.
6:05:56
Clara and Afterpay will only work on the 1997. Let me say that one more time. CLA
6:06:02
and Afterpay and our buy now pay later options will only work on the 1997. So,
6:06:08
if you want to test those out, go ahead and uh make sure that's selected. If you want the in-house plan, you can choose
6:06:14
the uh $107 over two months. That's charged every 30 days. Okay. So, if you
6:06:21
scroll down, you can go in here and uh you can fill out your credit card information and pay by card or CLA. If
6:06:28
you see, CLA can do four interestf free payments of $4.99
6:06:33
or you can stretch it out over 3 to 24 months. Now, some of you all may be thinking, Michael, I don't want to have a 24-month payment plan. Okay, you don't
6:06:42
have to have a 24-month payment plan if you want, but you can jump in and take advantage of this buy now pay later. And
6:06:47
guess what? You can get set up on a 12-month plan or a 24-month plan and pay
6:06:53
it off early. Pay it off early if you want. That's up to you, right? So, Afterpay is very good as well. You can
6:07:00
go um over up to six to 12 months. I would try both of them and see which one you get approved for. We have Amazon
6:07:07
Pay, Cash App Pay, all that fun stuff is on here. Um so, go test it out. See, I think they only do a soft pull on your
6:07:14
credit to see if you get approved. So, go on here and check it out. But all the other bonuses you all can read about read up on and what you get is all in
6:07:21
here. Um but all you have to do is go and and go check out, y'all. go to checkout. If you want a little bit more detail about what is inside, just scroll
6:07:27
down. You can read here. But we try to make this as simple as possible for you to jump in, right? Complexity
6:07:34
is is not is not our friend. We want to be as simple as possible. Now, like we told you all, we do have something
6:07:41
called elective financing. So, if you click this button here, uh, and it says need help with funding, it's going to
6:07:46
open up a page like this where you can actually go see with this new funding partner to see if you get approved and
6:07:53
they can potentially stretch the payments up to 3, 6, 9, or 12 months.
6:07:59
Okay, so Elective can stretch it out about the same as Clara and Afterpay as well. Now, you're like, Michael, which
6:08:04
one is better, Clara or Afterpay? The reason why I love elective is because it pulls on it pulls the credit report from
6:08:11
different bureaus. Okay? So, CLA and Afterpay, from my understanding, they pull on uh I'm just making this up. They
6:08:18
pull on one uh you know, credit bureau here. Well, Elective pulls from the opposite. So, if you get denied with CLA
6:08:24
and Afterpay, go try this platform because you never know, you might get approved. And there's no credit score
6:08:29
impact to see if you qualify if you live in the US. Make sure you all read the terms here below. Um, but there's no
6:08:35
late fees, hidden fees, prepayment penalties, and you can split your purchase into monthly payments. When you
6:08:41
click this button, it's just going to take you about two minutes to fill out some personal personal information to see if you get approved.
6:08:48
Now, um, I would say if this site is not loading for you, it may be because
6:08:53
everybody's going to that site. Okay? So, sometimes if you see the little spinning wheel of death, that means it's
6:08:59
just the the site's under heavy load and just refresh after a few minutes. Okay, so let me know in the chat if you're
6:09:05
working on it right now. Let me actually stop sharing my screen just for a few minutes and let me see if we have anybody else working on it in the room.
6:09:12
I'm going to give some shout outs to anybody who jumped in, but put working on it in the chat if you're still
6:09:17
working on it today. Okay, so shout out to I see Tique is working on it. EJ is
6:09:22
working on it. Let's go. Camila is working on it. Let's go. Shout out to you all. I love it. I love seeing action
6:09:29
takers. Anita is working on it. Let's go. Lori just jumped in. And everybody put congrats Lori for being in the room
6:09:36
with us. AI fueled profits. Lynn, congratulations. Awesome and amazing. So
6:09:42
y'all, I'm going to answer some more questions, but Lorett, before I go into these uh frequently asked questions, is
6:09:48
there anything that you are seeing that you want to answer? Anything you want to add on to all that?
6:09:54
Oh, no. Just I'm really excited about people this opportunity like like you were talking about. There's a a lot of
6:09:59
opportunities for learning. So, we give you so many different ways to learn on your own. Self-paced. I know some people
6:10:05
like the self-paced. I personally like to log in. I got a crazy, you know, I got two kids. I'm very busy. I sometimes
6:10:11
I can miss things. So, I like to log in and watch replays and take my time. So, we've got that option as well. Then we
6:10:16
have the live option. So, we've got way a lot of different ways for you to learn. Um, and then again, I love the
6:10:22
fact that you have the bonuses like the AI experts club to keep you up todate with what's going on with AI. So, very
6:10:28
important. So just you know some of the things on there with that ongoing learning. We love AI and I'm sure that you can see from our passion and that's
6:10:36
what we do and we bring it out to you and keep teaching you. And we bring other people in as well. So we don't
6:10:41
know everything. Sometimes we bring experts that are experts in specific areas of AI or specific areas to grow
6:10:47
your business and we'll bring them in as well for teaching and training in addition to just us. We have a team and
6:10:54
other guest speakers that come in as well. Thank you so much. Um, so a few people are asking in the chat, hey, how long is
6:11:00
this session going to go? Me and actually Loretta are just answering some questions in here. So if you don't have any questions and you know the AI fueled
6:11:07
profits is not for you. That's okay. We're just hanging out in here. Alisia is actually over inside of the VIPM
6:11:13
platinum session right now as we speak. They're you can actually head over there if you're VIPM platinum. Um, but you
6:11:19
know, me and Lored just going to hang out here. I may hang out for an hour or two. I don't know. I'm just here chilling with y'all. So, I just want to
6:11:25
make sure that you all have the ultimate clarity to jump in on this. Um, but what I'll say is, um, the team said, um, they
6:11:32
actually, let me see. Boom. Okay. Let me see. I'm just Okay, they said the pocket
6:11:40
guide. Yes. So, we can go ahead and drop the pocket guide. We are going to email it to everybody as well in the morning. Um, so the team is going to drop the
6:11:46
pocket guide in the chat real quick for you all for being in the room and staying to the very end. So, I'm going
6:11:51
to go ahead and drop that right now. Um, I believe I dropped it there. So, if you
6:11:56
want that pocket guide, go ahead and download it, but we will email it all everybody to who's registered. So, if you haven't registered for the summit
6:12:02
yet, you can go to aibusinesssummit.com. AI businesssummit.com will get you free
6:12:08
ticket to the summit. We still have two more days plus the bonus day for VIP and platinum, which is we just got started.
6:12:14
We just got started. So, u, if you're in here and you're like, hey, how long is this going to last? Um, the teaching for
6:12:19
the day is over. We're just answering questions on AI fueled profits to make sure you all have ultimate clarity.
6:12:24
Tomorrow we do start at uh 10 a.m. Eastern Standard Time for day two. We have Eric Thomas. We have Alicia Little
6:12:31
coming back up. We have Adley going to be talking about content with AI. We have Eric Sue, Myron Golden. We have so
6:12:38
much tomorrow. So be in the room. But um yeah, you can go and download that pocket guide right now.
6:12:45
All right. So a few other questions I'm seeing real quick. So, uh, I want to sh actually let me just do this. I'm going
6:12:51
to share my screen in just a minute. Not yet, team. I'm going to share my, uh, screen. There's a few of you all. You
6:12:57
said, "Hey, what other ways can we make an income with AI?" Would anybody want
6:13:04
to know how I made income with AI a little bit, you know, myself and just like how like some more creative ways of
6:13:09
how you could use AI to generate a generate an income? Put a yes in the chat. If you do, put a
6:13:16
yes in the chat. I want to know. So, what we're going to do is what we're going to do is is I'm actually going to
6:13:23
show you all um one way that I found that you can generate income by helping
6:13:28
other businesses make more sales and book more appointments. So,
6:13:34
I'm going to be honest with y'all. I'm not somebody that does this full-time what I'm about to show you, but we do it
6:13:41
in our agency a little bit. And this what I'm going to show you is just one of our accounts. GrowthHub can do what
6:13:46
I'm about to show you all. I'm going to show you um how I do it with another platform. But um long story short,
6:13:52
there's a lot of business owners out there that they are just lacking leads.
6:13:58
They are lacking leads. Or maybe at the other side of it, they
6:14:05
have a bunch of leads, but they just aren't doing anything with it. You're like, Michael, why would people not do
6:14:11
anything with leads? I don't know. That's a good question, but I guess people get busy. I guess
6:14:17
people just don't understand the value of the list they have. So, I'm going to show you all and I'm just going to kind
6:14:22
of give you a game plan on how you can go, you know, potentially go start maybe
6:14:27
a small agency or maybe go make a little income helping other business owners make sales. Now, I got a question for
6:14:34
you all about how much does it cost to hire a salesperson
6:14:40
within your organization? Everybody take a guess in the chat about how much does it cost to hire a salesperson
6:14:48
in a business. Let me know in the chat. I want to know how much you guys are guesstimating. Maybe some of you already have a sales team. Now, we do have an
6:14:54
amazing enrollment team. We have people on our team that they're phenomenal. So,
6:14:59
what I'm about to show is not to discount them, but I just want to show for some people this is going to be an
6:15:04
opportunity that could change their business and their life. All right, let me see what the chat is
6:15:10
saying over here. The chat is saying 40 to 60,000 a year. Okay, I saw that,
6:15:16
Jessica. Okay, who else? Who has a guess? I want I want to know.
6:15:22
I want to know. Let me see. $300. $300 what a day. Eric, let me know
6:15:28
what what you're thinking. All right. Somebody said 250,000 for a
6:15:34
sales team. Okay, let's let's just ask chat GBT team. Can I share my screen real quick? I just want to ask chat GBT.
6:15:40
Let's ask. Okay. Um, I want to hire a sales member for my uh company.
6:15:50
I'm doing some research
6:15:56
about how much should I uh budget for and what is normal to pay
6:16:03
a sales setter and a sales closer.
6:16:09
Here we go. So, let's just see what chat GBT comes up with based upon what I
6:16:14
asked. All right. So, a sales setter, if you guys don't know what a setter is, their role is to qualify and set
6:16:21
appointments with people that are actually like sales closers, right? So, they're not normally the ones setting
6:16:26
the deals. They're like reaching out to people trying to get them to book an appointment, right? So, a typical base
6:16:32
salary, it's saying, is $45 to $65,000 per year.
6:16:38
All right? That's just base salary. Now, let's go to a sales closer.
6:16:44
These are people that take the qualified leads, they do demos, and they actually close sales. This is saying a base
6:16:50
salary is about $40 to $70,000 a year. So, we're just going to say for these
6:16:55
for these roles, we're just going to say $50,000 a year. That's like the middle ground, right? All right, team. You can
6:17:00
you can stop the screen share for a second because I want to Who in here can afford $50,000?
6:17:07
Who in here can afford $50,000 right now? And that's just base only. That's not even counting commissions.
6:17:14
That's not even counting commissions. But the cool thing is, now this isn't
6:17:19
right for every company, so I'm not going to say it is because we have an amazing enrollment team and we actually
6:17:26
need some in-person sale sales individuals. But for some companies,
6:17:33
putting an AI agent in the mix could be exactly what they need or what you need.
6:17:40
So imagine an AI agent that closes deals for you,
6:17:46
qualify leads for you 24/7, even when you're asleep.
6:17:52
GrowthHub can actually do that, by the way. So that's why I'm trying to tell you to get the AI fuel profits because
6:17:57
that's something GrowthHub can do. But I'm gonna I'm going to tell you all.
6:18:03
Um, so I went to a client and this is just me. I'm giving you ideas of what's possible. I'm going to show you how you can make money with this.
6:18:10
Back Loretta, back in uh about five to six months ago, I went to a client and I
6:18:16
said, "Okay, I'm going to try this for the very first time." This individual had a 100,000 emails in his database and
6:18:23
100,000 phone numbers. And I said, "You're not doing anything with these phone numbers. You're not doing
6:18:29
anything." I said, "How about we go and do a re-engagement campaign or reactivation?" Everybody write this
6:18:35
down. reactivation campaign. I said, "How about we do a reactivation campaign to your audience and we use an AI agent
6:18:43
to create conversations and the AI agent will book appointments
6:18:49
for your in-person closers because he has some closers that he paid that were, you know, they were real human closers."
6:18:55
And I said, "How about we use AI to go create conversation qualify leads for these individuals?" He said, "Hey, what
6:19:01
what do you have to lose?" I said, "Nothing. It's just it's AI, right? So, let's try it. So, we built out this AI
6:19:07
agent and guess what? We started texting people. Texting people. Guess we were
6:19:13
having like hundreds and thousands of conversations a day. Let me know. Let me see who's in the room with us. Uh, let
6:19:19
me see who's in the room with us. Uh, let me see. We have Lester. Let me see. Lester or we have Felix. How long would
6:19:27
it take you all to go message just yourself? How long
6:19:32
would it take you to message let's just say a thousand plus people and have about a thousand plus conversations?
6:19:39
It would take me days to do. But the cool thing is we built this AI agent and
6:19:46
started having conversation with people because it's artificial intelligence and you can train it on the business and the
6:19:52
products and your tone. It had hundreds and thousands of conversations a day. And guess what? You, Lorett, in the
6:19:58
course of a month, we had over five to 600 booked appointments. Everybody just
6:20:04
put wow in the chat. Five. Literally sitting on a gold mine, right?
6:20:10
Literally a list he wasn't even using. Five to 600 appointments. Everybody just
6:20:16
put wow in the chat. So, it blew his mind. It generated them
6:20:22
a lot of money. thousands of dollars. Thousands of dollars. And guess what? It only cost a few hundred bucks with AI
6:20:29
credits, you know, because there's credits with things and but it was very minimal for an AI agent. Guess what?
6:20:34
That AI agent can work forever in his business. It's not Guess what? The AI agent isn't going to go on vacation. The
6:20:40
AI agent's not going to go uh and have a sick leave. It's not it's not going to take PTO.
6:20:47
The AI agent is going to be there 24/7. Yeah. So, Lorett, I want to show them. I just
6:20:52
want to tell them. So, number one, there's multiple ways you can go and capitalize off this idea.
6:20:57
Yes. Number one, you can go to business owners that number one, they have huge
6:21:03
lists like I just explained and go do these reactivation campaigns and say, "Hey, you have this list of 20,000,
6:21:09
50,000, 100, 500,000 leads. Let's just go and re-engage them all like fast with
6:21:15
AI and create conversations. Try to get some booked appointments." The second thing you could do is you could actually
6:21:21
um just set it up like follow-up sequences. So, let's say there's somebody they have maybe um you know
6:21:27
leads that they're getting in from you know ads or maybe they're you know I'm just making this up. Let's say somebody
6:21:33
has uh email marketing campaigns already doing it. Set up follow-up bots. So, it's not like a reactivation campaign
6:21:38
where you're going to all these leads that haven't been touched in a while. But, you know, when let's say that somebody comes in from an ad, guess
6:21:45
what? Maybe the ad maybe the person comes in at midnight and they're at scrolling on their phone and they click
6:21:50
an ad and they fill out a form. I'll be sleeping at midnight. The the
6:21:56
business owner sleeping at midnight. How are they supposed to respond to people fast? What if you build an AI agent to respond to them on the spot? Right? So,
6:22:03
these are different ways you could build these out and you just come in to the business owners because business owners don't know how to do this. Business
6:22:08
owners don't know exactly how to go build an AI agent. They'll look at you and say, "What's an agent? A real estate
6:22:14
agent? you want me to hire real estate? And you'll be like, no, no, no. An AI agent. I'm going to show you how to build an AI virtual team member.
6:22:22
And this is how you can get paid off of it. So, there's multiple ways that you can get paid off this. Number one, you
6:22:27
can charge per appointment. So, you can go to these business owners and say, "Hey, for every qualified appointment
6:22:33
that I book, you just I'll send you an invoice for it." So, let's say that. And some some
6:22:39
business owners will go $50, $100 per appointment. You do the math. You book
6:22:45
500 appointments for somebody and they're qualified, wellqualified, you know, appointments.
6:22:50
$50 times 500, that's that's a decent amount of, you know, income. So, you could charge per appointment. You could
6:22:57
just do a retainer style where you build, you know, you build the AI agent and they just pay you so much per month,
6:23:02
maybe5, $10,000 a month, $15,000 a month. You're like, Michael, people would people would pay you $15,000 a
6:23:09
month, $20,000 a month. Yeah, why not? I mean, we can build them as many AI agents as they want. I mean, somebody
6:23:15
just put in the chat, a team of five sales reps would be $250,000 a year. So,
6:23:21
yeah, people will. So, you can do cost, you could do charge per appointment. You
6:23:26
could do a retainer style or now listen, this one's a little bit more risky, right? This one's a little bit you have to be good with it. But you could also
6:23:33
do something where you go and you can go in and uh
6:23:39
you can go and actually take a percentage of any revenue that your your AI agent generates. So you say, "Hey,
6:23:44
we're going to go do this this reactivation campaign. We're actually going to go and you know what? Not just do the reactivation campaign, but we're
6:23:50
going to do the follow-up, you know, a agents for you, all these other things." And guess what?
6:23:56
You know what? We I'm I'm not even going to charge you that much upfront. I may charge like a little setup fee, but guess what? I'm just going to take a
6:24:01
percentage of every any revenue that comes through my AI agent. I'm going to take 30%, 25%, maybe 50% because listen,
6:24:09
if it's a reactivation campaign, it's money they wouldn't have had anyway. We're going to take 25% of any income
6:24:15
that comes in from our AI agent. Low risk, low risk for them, high reward
6:24:21
for you. Which one do you guys like? Which which model do you like? And so, this is just an idea. You don't have to
6:24:26
do this, but there's some of you in here you it piques your interest. You're like, "Oh, yeah. I want to do this." Like, that sounds good.
6:24:34
So, just know those are some ideas. Let me see in the chat.
6:24:39
Yeah, I love it. Somebody says, "Yes, an AI agent doesn't need PTO." Yep, for sure. They don't. They don't. So,
6:24:46
and you know, another thing that you were talking about that, Michael, when you were talking about the the how it blew their mind when you were giving
6:24:52
showing them what's possible. And the thing is, some people say, "Well, AI is so easy. Why don't they just go do it?" They're not going to do it. They're
6:24:58
busy. They're busy business owners. They don't want to learn how to build an AI agent. They don't want to learn how to
6:25:03
do that. They want you to do it. Even though it may be easy, they still want you to do it. And you're going to do it, and you're going to collect that that
6:25:09
that revenue for them. But, um, and that I love how you talked about that, Michael, too, because that also just
6:25:15
shows you how there's so many opportunities out there to earn, and now there's even more opportunities to earn
6:25:21
with AI. So, for example, something like that, like Michael's talking about, I wouldn't be able to do that myself if it
6:25:28
wasn't for AI. I didn't wouldn't even know where to start. All these websites that we're talking about that we're that you know we're building. Yeah, I used to
6:25:34
do that. We spent what 30 something thousand dollars took months to do. But now you have it's like the playing
6:25:39
ground is level. Like you can build a website yourself. You can implement these these them yourself. You can write
6:25:46
emails for people. You can do all these different things. Now, there's so many different opportunities that you can do.
6:25:51
the doors are wide open because of AI and that's something that we want to show you and help you with to see these
6:25:58
opportunities and how to take advantage of those as well. So, so many there's so many opportunities out there and it's
6:26:04
fun. This is exciting. Like Alicia talked about AI, we are in the gold rush right now. This is something that you
6:26:10
need to jump on right now and take advantage of it for sure. We had one of our students, he was talking about he
6:26:16
built a website after we taught about coding and how to teach. He built a website for a church and got paid very
6:26:22
nicely. Um, but he said it was so easy. He said he built a website in a couple hours and then the church he told the
6:26:28
the church the price, they paid it. Done. and he's like, "Wow, that was the easiest money I could have ever made and
6:26:33
now he's on to the next church." So, you know, just examples. And he has zero background in building websites, zero
6:26:39
tech background, but he was able to do in a few hours and earn some income from that. So, those are the kind of things
6:26:44
we want to show you the different opportunities that are out there and how you can take advantage of AI to help you
6:26:51
fulfill all those opportunities that are there. And then Michael, your training that you were talking about, that's
6:26:57
actually a bonus inside of AI Fueled Profits. Yeah. So people can learn all about that.
6:27:03
Yeah, there is a bonus training in there. But I love it because next week, if that piques your interest, you need to go into GrowthHub and the GrowthHub
6:27:09
challenge. The whole reason of me telling you all that, I mean, to be honest, y'all, was to show you that that can that can all be done. Everything I
6:27:16
just told you, everything I just painted a picture of can be done inside of
6:27:21
GrowthHub, which you get 30 days access. And somebody said, "Hey, what happens after 30 days?" Um, you can continue
6:27:27
using the platform. There is a monthly fee. I'm not exactly sure what that is. That'll be on the site when you you go
6:27:33
to your trial. You can continue using it, right? And if you want um and somebody says, "Is there a fee for AI
6:27:40
fueled profits after?" No. AI fueled profits there, it's just onetime fee. So, if you jump in and you go to get
6:27:45
aifueledprofits.com, you get signed up. It's just a onetime fee. There's not all these monthly
6:27:51
charges after. Now, there are the platforms that you can continue using like GrowthHub, but that's just up to you if you want to continue using those.
6:27:58
So, uh, real quick, I do want to pause and just give a shout out to a few individuals like Natasha. Shout out to
6:28:04
Natasha for jumping in. We have Evelyn who just joined. We had Maris just joined. Tammy just joined. Carol just
6:28:11
joined. Brian and Renee and Preston and Michael Patton and Terrence and Lisa.
6:28:17
Y'all, I can go on and on about everybody that's jumping in. So, just clap it up for them real quick. Clap it up for them. I'm excited. So, that's
6:28:24
GrowthHub is is just powerful, y'all. It's it's it's going to be a great platform and I'm excited for you to use it because um I see a couple people
6:28:31
asking in the chat, "Hey, is this only through like one platform? Like, how can the AI agents work?" We'll show you how
6:28:37
you can do it through email so the AI agents can converse with people right in your email inbox, SMS inbox, which is
6:28:45
texting. Uh you can do AI agents via phone calls, right? Uh you can even do
6:28:50
Facebook and Instagram inboxes and WhatsApp. So like it's it's so crazy.
6:28:56
You could do these AI agents and deploy them in many different places. Okay. And we're going to the way that we teach
6:29:02
you is that we're taking you through a challenge. So, we have a 4-day challenge and we're going to walk you through step
6:29:08
by step. So, we're not going to just give you a big old dump and say, "Hey, go to it." We're going to take you step by step, and it's a 4-day challenge. So,
6:29:15
step one, this is how you set it up. Step two, this is your next step. Step three, and it's a 4-day challenge. It's
6:29:20
going to be a lot of fun. Uh, it's very structured and organized to get you through. And at that end of the four
6:29:26
days, you're going to have an agent up and running and working, whether it is for your own business, whether you have
6:29:32
something set up for somebody else's business. But we're going to show you how to do that step by step with that
6:29:37
4day challenge. So again, like Michael said, once you register for AI Field Profits, you're going to get an email.
6:29:44
And when you get that email, you have to activate your account. You have to act activate your account in order to
6:29:50
proceed with the challenge. So that's very important. So, when you get that email, it's going to tell you to
6:29:55
activate your account, enter in your information, and get signed up. Once you do that, that triggers our system, and
6:30:01
we know that, hey, you're in the system, and we continue with you on that challenge that we're going to be having
6:30:06
next week. So, make sure you check that, look out for that email for everybody that joined. You will see that. Join,
6:30:12
fill out that information, and that's going to activate your account and then we can keep going with the
6:30:18
challenge. We can keep going with the challenge. I love it. Love it. I love it.
6:30:24
All right. All right. Awesome. Cool. So, um, team, the somebody said, "I missed the link." It's get a fueled profits.com. That link
6:30:31
is pinned to the top of the YouTube feed. So, at the very while you're watching on YouTube, make sure you click
6:30:37
the chat. Make sure you click the chat button on there. There's a white bar at the very top that has a link. Just click
6:30:42
that and you'll get put uh you'll be able to jump right on in. So, um, somebody says, um, I've been looking for
6:30:49
this. Well, I'm glad. I'm glad that you glad you're you're in with us. So, um this is what I'll say. Um you know, a
6:30:55
lot of individuals say, "Hey, is this for anybody at any age level because I may feel like I'm a little behind." Let
6:31:01
me just say AI, it doesn't matter what age you're in, what you know, what part of the world you're in, you can use AI
6:31:09
really anywhere in in in life. And so, the cool thing is, Lorett, you said we've had some, you know, even teens
6:31:15
come in and start using AI. But on the flip side, I mean, we've had individuals that are 70, 80 years old jumping in.
6:31:22
They're finding new excitement. They're finding new new wins, right, Loretta?
6:31:27
Well, you have a lot of people that say that I'm on my second wind right now. So, they're doing their, you know, they're retired. They're there. They
6:31:33
found something that they like. They find some they found something that they can do, but something that's interesting
6:31:39
to them, not hard to use. And we're the community that we build here is very
6:31:44
welcoming, as you can tell. So, you know, we help you, we guide you, we encourage you, we motivate you. So,
6:31:50
you're in the right place. Don't be intimidated by saying, "Oh, I I'm too old or I'm not tech-savvy or anything
6:31:56
like that." None of that matters. That's why we help you throughout the whole program. We can we'll hold your hand.
6:32:01
We'll show you how to do things. But the thing is is that AI, it's not that hard. You just have to have a system and you
6:32:07
need somebody to guide you along to help you. And that's what we're there. And you need to know the specific tools.
6:32:13
Once you get that, you learn, you are on a roll. And especially because it's fun. Like I like using AI. And I think
6:32:19
everybody here, I see the chats, people are going crazy when Alicia is showing this, showing that. Wow, amazing this.
6:32:25
It's fun. I actually like doing this. And if you're still here listening to this, then you probably like it, too. So
6:32:32
don't be intimidated thinking that you're not technical or maybe you're too old or something like that, that
6:32:37
definitely does not matter at all. Right. Thank you, Lorett. The goal is you all that we actually provide the
6:32:44
ecosystem and support that you need to win. That's all we're trying to do here. Um, a lot of you all you've been seeing
6:32:49
these AI tools. You've been seeing AI and you're just like, I kind of know how to use it, kind of don't. So, we just
6:32:55
said, hey, let's just create a platform and a a coaching program where people can come in and they just get, you know,
6:33:02
all the help they need with artificial intelligence. And so, that's the goal, right? And this is this isn't for everybody. For some of you all, like you
6:33:08
may not be ready for this right now. You may not be able to jump into a coaching program. But the cool thing is it is
6:33:13
self-paced. So if you're not in a season where this fits right now, just, you know, jump in and maybe start two weeks
6:33:18
from now, three weeks from now, right? Um, but this is good. I seen somebody put in the chat, this is this has been the best investment ever for me. Um, NI
6:33:27
Magazine. I don't know your full name, but she they just said, "This was the best investment I've ever made. I love it." Um, so listen, this is this is
6:33:34
great. Are there any additional costs? Perry says, "After the 1997, uh, no."
6:33:39
Unless you want to continue with the AI experts club, which is a bonus. Unless you want to continue using GrowthHub,
6:33:45
you don't have to. There's no other fees like those those are just bonuses on top of it, right? Um now any softwares we
6:33:52
recommend and things, you know, that would be on top as well. But again, you could do a lot with chat GBT or Google
6:33:57
Gemini, which are very lowcost platforms. So we, you know, as you've seen, we accomplished a lot today. If
6:34:03
you're here and you just jumped in and you missed the beginning, you need VIP and platinum because we went over how to
6:34:10
write copy with AI. We went over how to create images with AI for your business. We did so many things this morning. And
6:34:17
so we have more to cover tomorrow and the rest of the week, but make sure you get those replays. Okay, so um and also to go on to that. So some
6:34:24
people may say, "Oh, well today I already missed it." It doesn't matter. We still have more days to come and you
6:34:30
are going to get those VIP replays to go back and listen to it over and over and over again. So, if you didn't get VIP,
6:34:36
you still have time. You still have time. Definitely go get VIP. Get the replays because I'm sure you learned
6:34:42
something today that you probably didn't know before, right? So, you want to make sure you have that replay so you can go watch it again. So, those are the VIP.
6:34:49
Definitely get VIP. It's not too late. It's not too late. I love it. One person asked the
6:34:56
question, which is a great one. Um, this one right here was, "What is the difference between this and the
6:35:01
certification that um, Alicia was talking about." So, you may have heard her allude to an AI uh, certified
6:35:08
consultant program that we have. And we do, you know, that is a private program. We don't talk about it a lot because it
6:35:14
is a higher level program. Um, but that's specifically around if you want to consult businesses and show them how
6:35:20
to implement AI into their ecosystems. And so Lorett, I'll let you talk about that briefly and just talk about the
6:35:26
differences in team. We could drop the link if people want to book a call for it. You know, that's, you know, just
6:35:31
don't book a call if you're not really interested, you're not really, you know, curious and really want to show up and
6:35:36
actually be on that call. But, uh, just tell them about it real quick, Loretta, and then our team can drop a link for those that want to actually book a call.
6:35:42
Perfect. So, just to kind of talk about the difference. So, AI Fuel Profits teaches you how to find your profit path
6:35:48
and different ways to earn with AI. So, there's a variety of different ways like we've talked about. You can write a book, you can sell prompts, you can do
6:35:56
AI photo shoots, like all these different things that you can do to earn with AI. And one of those ways that you
6:36:02
can do is become an AI consultant. Now, when you're an AI consultant, that's when you get paid to teach somebody
6:36:08
about AI. So, that can be in a variety of different ways. You can teach like this. You can do Zoom teaching and train
6:36:14
about AI. You can go into people's companies and organizations and do training with their employees. You can
6:36:20
do summits, you can do virtual events, you can do courses, but it's basically teaching other people about AI. And when
6:36:27
we teach about AI, we're not teaching about something super complicated. The stuff that we talked about today about
6:36:33
writing email campaigns, those are the types of things that we're teaching when we're going into different organizations
6:36:39
and corporations. So, if you'd be interested in teaching something like that, letting people know about AI, then
6:36:45
that's when you would become an AI consultant. It is a certified program. We are CPD accredited which is
6:36:51
continuous professional development. It is a globally recognized certification but we certify you to become AI
6:36:57
consultants and you go through our training program. It's very robust lots of training in there. It's built in two
6:37:04
separate kind of ways. Teaches you how to be a consultant like so proposals discovery calls finding clients all that
6:37:11
kind of consultant part of it. And then we also teach you about AI like the tools that you need to be an to be a
6:37:18
great consultant not only for yourself but also tools that you could use to implement into businesses. So that's our
6:37:24
AI consultant certification program. Um it is our flagship. People love it. So
6:37:30
if you interested in that you can book a call with our team. Now if you book a call with the team that's for you to ask
6:37:36
more questions about being a consultant. So they're on standby waiting, listening, you know, ready to talk to
6:37:42
you more about the program so you can learn more about it on how to become a consultant. So that link right there is
6:37:48
uh to book a call with the team to talk about the program to see if it's a good fit for you.
6:37:54
Awesome and amazing. I love it. So uh one thing that I seen in the chat, somebody says, "Can you drop the link?"
6:37:59
Yes, the team is about to drop it right now. So team, drop the link for people to book a call for the consultants. I'll
6:38:05
pin it once I see it in the chat, but go now. Listen, our team only has limited availability. If you're interested in
6:38:12
the in the certification, listen, please, please, please show up.
6:38:17
Book that call fast, fast fast because we only have limited spots. And um
6:38:23
somebody sure says, "How how do we book a call?" The team's going to drop a link in the chat right now for you all. So,
6:38:28
just go ahead and click that and then I'll pin it to the top. But go ahead and book it. And then after you book your call, go ahead and just put booked in
6:38:35
the chat so I know you booked and so I can let the team know. I'll just kind of text them offline and save this chat.
6:38:41
Um, so go ahead and do that right now. So team, um, Jay, if we have that, I don't know if we have those links, um,
6:38:48
we could drop that'd be amazing. Um, so looks like the team maybe
6:38:53
let me grab that link real quick. I don't know if they're just busy with support. Um, so let me grab that real quick.
6:39:00
Lorette, can you text me the one you have real quick so I can just paste it in real quick? That'd be great. Just text it to me. So, I'll paste it in the
6:39:06
chat. Just one moment, y'all. So, um I'm interested. I love it. I love it. Awesome. And, uh, you know, if you
6:39:13
at least have at least any little interest in it, um, you can go ahead and do it. So, u, they want to know, so
6:39:20
Profit on Watch said, uh, Lorett, can you name what what's it certified through again? Can you say that one more time?
6:39:26
It's CPD certification. So continuous professional development that is the the
6:39:31
name of the governing body CPD standards. Yes. And not only is our comp
6:39:38
is the certification is CPD certified but also our company is also CPD
6:39:44
certified as well. So not only is it just the program but also the company and we had to go through a lot to get
6:39:50
that. So, it's not just some certification, oh, get certified by Alicia and Lorett, which is fantastic,
6:39:55
but it's actually like we had they had to go through the curriculum. They had to interview some of our past students.
6:40:01
We had to fill out a whole bunch of stuff in order to get that seal to say that we are CPD certification. CPD
6:40:07
certified. So, I love it. I love it. I love it. So, the link's in the chat. Go ahead and and go
6:40:12
ahead. It's going to ask you a few questions. It may ask you like about your goals, where you're at right now.
6:40:17
So, just go ahead take a few seconds to go fill that out. And once you're done booking your call, just put done in the chat. But the team's going to kind of
6:40:23
spam the chat because I know many of you are wanting that. So, go ahead and do that right now. Um, somebody says, "I
6:40:28
have a website, but want to see what AI can make for me." Yes. Oh, man. AI is crazy, you all. Actually, some some of
6:40:34
the people that I'm around, they've been making landing pages for their webinars, for their products, literally within
6:40:41
minutes. And it was really cool. So, when somebody was like, "Hey, Michael, can you send can you send a proposal to
6:40:47
me?" And Lorett, I was like I started going through Quickbooks and go on Canva to create like a fancy proposal. I'm
6:40:54
like this gonna take me forever. So I just I said let's go to let's just go to Lovable and I said I'm going to create
6:40:59
me a proposal real quick. So I went on Love and I kind of spoke into I was like I want to create this and now within
6:41:04
like probably 10 to 15 minutes which would have took me a couple hours designing it and like making it look
6:41:10
really sleek and modern. I went in and literally I had a full website proposal I get sent over after 10 or 15 minutes
6:41:17
to somebody. Okay, so y'all uh we may talk about that and we may have somebody come and talk about that a little later, but that's definitely something inside
6:41:23
of AI Fueled Profits for some of y'all that want to specialize in that or really lean into that. Just know we do
6:41:29
have that available for you inside of there. So, um somebody says, "How much is it?" Um book a call. I think there's
6:41:36
different tiers depending on, you know, where your what your income goals are, where you're at. So, there's different
6:41:41
types of options with it. There's also other programs as well because somebody they may look at your situation and say,
6:41:46
"Hey, um I I think it's B. Hey, B. Um I don't I don't really think you're a good
6:41:53
fit for this, but we have this other program you're a good fit for." Because we have multiple different things, but AI Field Profits is a special summit
6:41:59
only opportunity for $19.97 we're offering here. And this is where most people will start out because it's, you
6:42:05
know, the ground level. You're discovering how to make AI income. But there are some of you all that you want to become cert, you know, certified. So
6:42:12
that is an opportunity for you all. So um what's the cost or the bonuses? The
6:42:17
bonuses are inside of the AI fueled profit. So it's not an additional cost. It's included. So you see saw all those
6:42:24
crazy bonuses. Those are included with the program. Okay. So let me give a shout which is a lot.
6:42:29
Yeah. Yeah. Quite a bit. Quite a bit. So I'm going to give a shout out to a few individuals who jumped in recently uh
6:42:35
since the last time I actually went ahead and was giving shoutouts to people. So Joanne just got in.
6:42:40
Congratulations, Joanne, for jumping in. Uh, let me give a shout out to Let me refresh my screen here. If you're still
6:42:47
working on it, you're like, "Yo, I'm going to find a way to get into this program." Um, just let me know in the
6:42:52
chat so I can shout you out. But shout out to Kathleen just got a platinum said, "Hey,
6:42:58
I'm joining that platinum room." Awesome. Rick Tisha just got AI fueled profits. I love it. I love it. So, this
6:43:04
is what I want to say real quick. There's a lot of y'all you're making this decision. You're like, "Man, this may be good for me. and may not. I just
6:43:11
want you to think I mean you do have you have two choices here. You can go the rest of the week and get the free information which is great and you can
6:43:17
go try to like implement AI into your business and your life by yourself. The issue is I personally think the issue is
6:43:25
is that AI moves so fast. AI moves so fast and there's always new tools coming
6:43:30
out. There's always changes to the tools that you are using. Why not block arms
6:43:36
with somebody that is on top of the tools? We have an entire team that
6:43:41
that's all they do is they're updating programs. They're they're researching everyday tools and resources for you.
6:43:47
Why not lock in there versus you going and trying to figure this out alone and going and watching a hundred different YouTube videos, going to a 100 different
6:43:54
summits. Why don't you just lock in once and then ultimately I truly believe this is like investing for speed,
6:44:01
right? This is like you're investing for speed. You can go do this alone, which some of you will do. But for others, the
6:44:08
other option is just locking arms with a coach that's been there, that knows the way, that knows all the platforms, that knows all the softwares, and that you
6:44:14
can come and ask questions to really anytime. So, that's the decision I want you to make today. I know there's a lot
6:44:20
of you all you're like, maybe. I don't I just don't like maybe. Like, it's a yes or a no in my eyes. Make a decision.
6:44:25
Jump in. Um, don't let fear stop you. Like we talked about this morning whenever when we first started, you know, a lot of individuals are saying,
6:44:31
"But what if what if I take this leap and I can't figure out how to use AI or, you know, I can't figure out like my
6:44:37
income path." Listen, you're asking the wrong what if. You're saying, "What if I I jump and I fall flat on my face?"
6:44:43
Don't be asking that. The real what if you should be asking yourself is, "Hey, what if I take that leap and actually
6:44:50
soar? I fly higher and I actually do more than I ever thought I would because it's possible." You all listen, AI makes
6:44:58
so many things easier, automated, a little bit more automated.
6:45:03
So don't don't be asking yourself and telling yourself, "What if this doesn't work? What if this is quit? Throw that
6:45:09
out the window. What if this does work? What could happen for you and your life
6:45:14
and your family?" Some of you all, listen, this may just be a little hobby. Some of y'all, it may replace your
6:45:19
full-time job. For some of you all, guess what? It may allow you to go travel and provide the freedom that you
6:45:25
you've always wanted. For others, it may just being, you know what, I found a new hobby that you know is is fun in, you
6:45:32
know, in the off time when I'm I'm off from work. You know, for some of you all, you may find a way to actually do a lot of charity work with AI. Believe it
6:45:38
or not, we have a lot of students and Alicia has found ways to give back with AI, which is really cool, right? So,
6:45:44
there's different different places you may be, but the goal is that I want you to decide today like, hey, which path am
6:45:49
I going? Am I going to choose a coach? And some of y'all, you're working on it. I and I want to salute you. You're in there. You're filling out the elective
6:45:55
application. You're trying CLA. You're trying Afterpay. You're trying to contact our team. We got you. And
6:46:01
actually, I'll just do this. If you have a question, team, can we drop the link for people or the phone number for
6:46:07
people to text us if they have questions about the program?
6:46:13
If you have questions about the program, our team's going to drop a cell phone number. Now, here's the deal, though. Don't call this number cuz this this
6:46:21
number they're they're using it right now to dial and you probably won't get through. But
6:46:27
but you can go ahead and text the number and just say, "Hey, I'm interested in
6:46:32
the program. Hey, I'm I'm interested in the certification. Hey, I'm interested in AI
6:46:37
Fuel Profit." So the team's going to drop that cell phone number in the chat right now and just text us if you're if
6:46:43
you really want to find a way in. If you're like, "Hey, I would love to get in. I just need to split up the credit cards and debit cards.
6:46:49
Hey, I need I need maybe a little bit more help. I think we actually have another company that's not on the website that can potentially help you
6:46:56
get in. I think it's a little bit more complex like application process. I could be totally wrong on that. So, that's why it
6:47:02
wasn't on the site, but I think there's another even another option you can choose and you can ask our enrollment team about and they can help you walk
6:47:08
through it. So, the cell phone number if you all want to take advantage of this is 470
6:47:16
8353282. Let me say it one more time. 470-835
6:47:24
3282. And you can text us and say, "Hey, I'm interested in the program." We will do whatever we can to help you get in.
6:47:30
We will do whatever we can to help you get in. So, um I'm going to let you Alicia, I'm going to Lorett, sorry, I
6:47:35
just called you Alicia. My bad. I'm going to go ahead pass you over a few questions um that you can answer. Um I'm going to
6:47:42
grab me another water. So, I'm going to step out. I'm going to pass you a couple questions. I'm going to grab me some water. Um, and then I'm going to come
6:47:49
back and I may have a special guest. I just got a text somebody saying, "Hey, how's it going?" Like, "Do you need
6:47:55
anything?" And I'm like, "Uh, maybe I can maybe bring you guys want me to bring on a special guest. Would that be
6:48:00
valuable for you guys?" All right, cool. I may do that. So, uh, what I want to do, Loretta, is a few
6:48:06
question. There's two questions. All right. And then I don't Do you have the YouTube chat in front of you?
6:48:11
Actually, I do. I'm looking at it right now. Okay. So this is one this is one I saw uh just a few minutes ago.
6:48:17
This question was um would I be able to learn how to write my own book? So that was one I saw that was like a
6:48:23
little bit ago. Okay. So would I be able to learn my own book in this write my own book in this? And then also um if I can if I jump in
6:48:30
later this week will I miss anything? So those were two writing a book will I miss anything if I jump in later this
6:48:36
week? Yeah. All right. So first of all the writing a book. Yes. That is actually one of the profit paths that we talk
6:48:42
about inside of AI field profits. We actually have a GPT that we created and it is called Bookbot Pro. So with
6:48:50
Bookbot Pro, it actually walks you through either how to start your book from scratch or it can help you complete
6:48:55
your book. So there's a lot of people who have their book started. I think we actually showed a testimonial from
6:49:01
somebody saying that she's been working on her book for two years and I think a lot of you can relate to that. So we can
6:49:07
help you that Bookbot Pro is what it's called. It can help you finish it. It can also help you start it. So, yes, you
6:49:12
can get your book finished. And then Alicia was showing you how to create those book covers. So, you can now have
6:49:18
a finished book with writing it and the book covers. Um, and the other question was if you start a little bit late, it
6:49:24
doesn't matter. So, you can start first of all, everything that we do is always recorded. So, if you miss it, you can
6:49:30
always get the recording. And then we have continuous learning. So if you join now and you miss the boot camp for
6:49:36
example, we have these boot camps on a regular basis. So you will be invited to the upcoming book boot camp after this.
6:49:43
So not to worry if you miss that. So those are always um additional options that everything's recorded and we have
6:49:50
ongoing learning if you miss something. Now I saw another question that I wanted to answer. Somebody was saying, "I
6:49:56
really love your tool stack, but are you going to teach us how to create these tools?" Yes, we are. And that is
6:50:03
actually part of the live hands-on when we do that workshop style. So when we do that 3-day workshop, part of that is
6:50:10
building apps so that you can build tools just like some of the tools that we're using. So we've actually I know
6:50:16
Michael did um but we have some tools that we use on a regular basis. And he saw this tool and he said, "Hey, I bet I
6:50:23
could make the same tool and make it better." And he did. So now he has this tool that he made by just kind of
6:50:29
duplicating something that we already had. And that's an example of some of the things that we're going to teach you
6:50:34
how to do. All right. And then another question I saw that came in was asking about any additional fees. So just want
6:50:41
to be transparent with that. When we have this program, it is that onetime price. So that 1997 is that's it for the
6:50:48
program. If you do a payment plan, you know, that would be your payment plan that you have as far as other things.
6:50:54
So, you do get the AI experts club for 90 days and you get that free. After the 90 days, you don't have to stay if you
6:51:00
don't want to. No contracts or anything like that. You just let us know. If you do want to stay, it's $47 a month, which
6:51:07
is dirt cheap for all the learning that you're going to be you have that you have in there. For the GrowthHub 365,
6:51:14
same thing. You get that trial for 30 days. And if you want to continue, there is a monthly fee for that. But again,
6:51:20
you don't have to if you don't want to. So, those are things that you get free trials for. Now, a lot of the tools that
6:51:25
we introduce, most of them are free or they have free levels. So, you know, if you're a beginner or if you only use it
6:51:32
every once in a while, then you usually don't have to pay anything. Now, if you want to become an expert in that, let's
6:51:37
say you're taking a liking to creating videos, you're like, I love AI videos. So, you can get that free trial, but now
6:51:44
you're like, I'm going to be the master at it. Then you may want to upgrade to get the, you know, a more paid version
6:51:50
for it. So most of our students, they like to take the free trials, then they find something they really like and then
6:51:56
they go ahead and upgrade on that particular tool. But you're not going to have to get like 50 tools and pay all
6:52:01
these subscriptions. You only choose the ones that you're going to use and that that you know that you want to have. All
6:52:07
right, let's see. Another question as far as the um
6:52:15
certification. So how long does the certification ask take? So, people were asking about our AI consultant
6:52:22
certification program. Now, it is laid out for three months. You don't have to do it for three months. We've had a lot
6:52:28
of students do it a lot faster. I mean, it really is up to you. You go through the curriculum and then at the end of
6:52:33
the curriculum, you have assessments that you have to take. You take these assessments and then you can get certified. So, it really is up to you,
6:52:40
but we we recommend 3 months to take it. You can do it shorter, you can do it longer as well.
6:52:47
Um, all right. So, yes. So, I see somebody saying, "This is a lot of
6:52:53
information. I want to talk to somebody about it." No problem. So, that team had the team dropped the link for book a
6:52:59
call. So, if you can go ahead and book a call, if you've got questions, you're not really sure which program is a good
6:53:05
fit for you, then you can go ahead and uh book a call with the team and the team will help answer your questions.
6:53:13
Okay. All right. So question is this all in school? So it depends on the program
6:53:20
that you have. So our AI fuel profits is not in school. It's in one of our other training platforms with all the
6:53:26
different modules. We have AI experts that is in school. So those are two different platforms, but you can go um
6:53:32
and go in both one for different reasons. Yep. All right. Do you see the back mic? Did you get your drink?
6:53:39
Drink. I apologize. I know you're feeling worse than me, so I apologize about that. Um, but no, I wanted to go
6:53:44
ahead and um, number one, the VIP and Platinum are about to have a special guest. And so the individual, he was
6:53:52
like, we're here in the studio and he was peeking through and he was like, hey, do you guys need anything? I'm like, no, we no, we're good. I'm kind of
6:54:00
between you answering questions like, no, we're good. And he said, can I just come on before I go to VIP and platinum?
6:54:05
Can I just say something to the general mission on YouTube? I said, sure, why not? Like that'd be cool. And so we
6:54:11
have, is it okay if we bring on a guest speaker? Just put yes in the chat. This is literally impromptu. This was not
6:54:16
planned. This was not something that we had actually in the books. Um, but this is just something we decided to do last
6:54:22
minute. So, is it okay for you all if we go ahead and do that? Just put a yes in the chat. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.
6:54:28
Cool. So, who I'm about to bring up to the stage, I'm excited about because this is an individual that's made a lot
6:54:33
of money, a lot of money online, and he's going to show you all how you can maybe go generate some extra revenue and
6:54:40
how you can go get some more reach online yourself. And so, Regina, I hope you're ready. I see y'all commenting the
6:54:46
yeses in the chat. I see Biz Queen, I hope you're ready. So, I'm going to welcome up to the stage. He was supposed to be VIP and platinum only, but he's
6:54:52
going to come on just for a few minutes and talk to y'all. I want to welcome up to the stage, Mr. Nehemiah Davis. So, I'm going to let you have the mic, man.
6:54:59
I I apologize for not having a better setup for you. It's all good. It's all good. What's up, family? How How we feeling today,
6:55:05
family? First, I'm trying to see where I'm looking at. Where we looking at? I'm trying to see my comments over here. Uh,
6:55:10
great consultant. What's up, family? Uh, I'm trying to see who we all got in the building. Let me know where y'all tuning
6:55:16
in from real quick. I'm just looking real quick. Let me know where y'all tuning in from real quick. Let me know where y'all tuning in from real quick.
6:55:22
What's up, Loretta? I see you over here. I'm just tuning in. I sound like you're getting sick. It sound like Michael's
6:55:29
getting sick. I mean, y'all been going at it. So, really quick, um, y'all, I just wanted to come on here really quick
6:55:34
to say one of the biggest themes that I'm pushing for 2026 before I get into a
6:55:41
little bit of game. I don't got much time in front of us today, but the biggest theme that I am pushing for 2026
6:55:48
is expectancy. Right. Expectancy. What?
6:55:53
You hear me? Right. We're good. I'm good. expectancy, right? What what does this mean? Right? I need you to understand
6:56:00
that this year and every year after everything that you want will 100% come
6:56:06
true, but you have to one, believe it. And two, you got to be willing to put the work. And so, number one, I want to
6:56:11
say it again, there's a two-part formula to this. Number one, you have to believe it. And number two, you got to put in
6:56:18
the work. One of my favorite books that I want you guys to pick up is Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by
6:56:24
Steven Cvy. God rest his soul. And one of the chapters in a book that I started to read what 15 16 years ago was called
6:56:32
begin with the end in mind. And if anybody here listening like the concept of beginning with the end in mind is
6:56:39
that told me earlier on you have to arrive at the destination in your mind before you arrive there in your life.
6:56:45
Right? So as I want to say it one more time. You have to arrive at the destination in your mind before you
6:56:51
arrive there in your life. which means is you got to believe that you can achieve it. You got to believe you can
6:56:56
generate the income. You got to believe you can start the AI business. You got to believe you can grow an agency. You
6:57:02
got to believe you can save time. Like you have to know without a shadow of a doubt you are going to get there. Right?
6:57:09
So the next thing I want y'all to really start asking yourself is when I really
6:57:14
start thinking about life, right? And be honest. Anybody here, keep it all the way real with me. Anybody here life is
6:57:20
lifing? Like I mean we've 2025, right? I'm grateful to be in 2026, but
6:57:27
2025 I heard so many people just talk about how life was life and how challenging it
6:57:34
was, how tough it was. And and grant I faced it some challenges there. But one
6:57:40
of the things, the key thing that I tell people you have to do, and I want y'all to put it in the chat, the biggest key
6:57:46
that we have to do is keep going. No matter what, no matter what's going on, no matter what h what is happening, like
6:57:53
no matter what am I up against, I am going to keep going. I'm not going to quit. I am going to win. I'm going to
6:57:59
find a way to win. Right? So, as we go and continue into the year, you have to
6:58:05
know in your mind like it is going to work. Nothing is going to stop me. No matter what tough times I'm going
6:58:11
through right now, no matter what's happening right now, I know this is going to work for my future. I know I'm
6:58:17
going to be successful. I know I'm going to win. So, I just wanted to give you guys a bit of encouragement to let you
6:58:24
know like don't stop. Keep going. Next thing, man, it's funny. One of my mentors, it's funny. Myin Golden is a
6:58:31
mentor of mine. Um, and I saw a video and he talked about this concept and it's called become more findable. And I
6:58:39
want to quickly talk about it very quickly. Become more findable. Right? What does this mean, Nehemiah? One of my
6:58:45
other mentors, Grant Cardone, he says this quote, and I love the quote so much. He says, "If they do not know you,
6:58:51
they cannot flow you." And why am I sharing that with you? Because some of you are extremely good at what you do,
6:58:57
but no one knows what you do. Some of you got the best baking business, but no one knows about it. Some of you are the
6:59:02
best hairdresser, but no one knows about it. Some of you do the best uh you you may be the best math tutor, and no one
6:59:09
knows about it. And one of the ways that you can change this is with a content
6:59:15
distribution system. I want to say it again, a content
6:59:22
distribution system. So, okay, there's multiple ways that you can do this and I want to break several of these ways
6:59:28
down. The very first thing that I would highly recommend you do, and I used to teach this concept, but I added this
6:59:33
piece to it. it is. You need to book a day with a videographer. Book a day with a
6:59:40
videographer, a photographer, and I'm about to show you how to get the most out of it. Somebody say the most. Here's
6:59:46
what I would like you to do. The very first day, I want you to go download, hey Jen, and I want you to download 11
6:59:52
Labs. And you're going to give them clear instructions. The first thing you want to do is to be able to create
6:59:59
your clone. Now again, the the more advanced you want your clone, the more you have to
7:00:06
train the model, the more videos that you have to do. But you know what the cool thing is about training your clone
7:00:12
is that you have to do the videos anyway. So on this particular day that you guys
7:00:19
are going to go do your videographer day with your videographer, I want you to go ahead and bring yourself five different
7:00:25
outfits. And granted, I know some of you like, Neil, I don't want to create more content. I know, I get it. But once you
7:00:31
have your clone created, we don't have to create anymore. We now can let the clone create. But while we're out here,
7:00:38
we might as well maximize this opportunity. So one, we're going to go ahead and sit down. We're going to download Hey Jen, create the account.
7:00:44
You're going to download 11 Labs, create the account. You're first going to get your voice to clone done.
7:00:52
Once you're done that, you're going to get your video clone done. So now you're able to have a completed clone, right?
7:00:59
These sites are going to help you build this from scratch. Your very next thing that you're going to do, I want you guys
7:01:04
prior to you going is preparation. I heard Alex Hermoszi say the other day is they're spending more time
7:01:12
preparing the content than actually shooting the content.
7:01:17
So what does this mean? One of the things I want you to do is my goal for you is to become one of the
7:01:24
top people in your industry. I want you to be known as the best baker. I want you to be known as the best tutor. I
7:01:31
want you to be known as the best piano person. Whatever it is that you are, I want you to be known as the best in
7:01:37
this. Right? Let me know if this is helpful for anybody in the chat.
7:01:42
Let me know if this is helpful for anybody in chat. So, in order for you to be known at the best, you have to put out your best content. So, one of the
7:01:49
things I want you to do is I want you to go find one or two people in your industry that do what you do. You take
7:01:56
their names, you go put them in chat GPT. You say, "Go find me five to 10
7:02:02
other people like this." You then go find their top three videos
7:02:08
from each creator, their top three videos that went viral, and you recreate the video that already went viral if it
7:02:16
is not timesensitive. Right? So, if this isn't a video from 2020 and they we're talking about this old way of marketing,
7:02:22
this old way of business. So, what did we just do right there? We
7:02:29
found our creators. And here's another website. You could go to viralfinder.com and you could find these creators and
7:02:35
viral content in your niche. And all we are doing is recreating the content. The
7:02:40
very next thing in creating content
7:02:45
that goes viral, let me give you this. The next thing in
7:02:50
creating content that goes viral is all around creating hooks. So when you are
7:02:56
doing your videos, I want you to go ahead and create you go you you go listen to the hooks of
7:03:03
the top three creators. Each of them go see the beginning of their video and you
7:03:08
go ask chat GPT to create me 20 30 different video hooks
7:03:14
that will go viral for this particular content that I'm teaching or that I'm talking about.
7:03:22
Right? So what does this mean y'all? We now got the hooks. Hooks are are are are
7:03:28
ways to grab you in the first few seconds of the video. Your business is not growing because
7:03:36
the quickest way to grow your hair is
7:03:41
your content sucks because some of the hooks are polarizing, but
7:03:47
what do they do? A hook is designed to stop you in your tracks.
7:03:53
So now what we're doing now, now we're going to spend some time recording videos that day. Let me go ahead and
7:03:58
give you the breakdown for those who want to record the videos. You one need to record you a 8-minute video.
7:04:04
Why? Now we got some content, a long form video for YouTube. And now you got a bunch of shorts.
7:04:10
Two, you want to go ahead and record you 10 to 50 one to three minute videos
7:04:17
leveraging the hook process that I just showed you. What's another strategy that you could do with this same exact
7:04:23
process? You can literally go on chat GPT and ask it to create your scripts.
7:04:28
You can download a app on your phone called big view. And big view is a teleprompter app. And what the
7:04:34
teleprompter app, what this teleprompter app allows you to do
7:04:41
is record all the content reading off a teleprompter with a chat GPT script.
7:04:47
And now what's the next thing we do? We now take the same content. Let me
7:04:54
show you a quick strategy. Anybody interested in this? Anybody want to learn how to turn one video into five videos, five videos and 25 videos, 25
7:05:01
videos into 125 videos at the end of every one of your videos, and I wish I would have learned this sooner, is you
7:05:08
got to create a different ending per video. If you're interested in learning more, comment below. If you're
7:05:14
interested in learning more, subscribe to my channel. If you're interested in learning more, share this with a friend.
7:05:20
If you're interested in learning more, visit my website. If you're interested in purchasing something today, go here.
7:05:26
So now I just took one video. I put five different endings on a video. And now I have a video per platform. I got a video
7:05:33
for Instagram. I got a video for YouTube shorts. I got a video or a post for
7:05:39
threads. Right? So what did I just do? Now you are now becoming omniresent. And what
7:05:45
I've come to learn is you only need one piece of video to go viral. What's another way to go viral with a little
7:05:52
bit of following? This is what I call hero content.
7:05:58
What hero content is, it lets me know where you were to where you are. So, one of my good friends, Terra Lynn Smith, we
7:06:05
created a viral meme that showed her when she was younger. Now, we showed her where she owning all this property. And
7:06:11
it goes from homeless sleeping under a bridge to building an eight figureure real estate empire.
7:06:18
Homeless to sleeping under the bridge to building an eight figure real estate empire. So, what everybody here is going
7:06:23
to do, you're going to write where you were to where you are now.
7:06:29
Kicked out of high school and college and fired from 10 jobs to now running an eight figureure business. My story. And
7:06:35
you're showing where you were to where you are. And this viral piece of content
7:06:41
is normally going to be the content that you're going to put out. And then once it go viral, you now take the same
7:06:48
content and now you go ahead and put it on what I call shout out pages with further put your content out. So you
7:06:54
could become a known figure with your business in the next several months just
7:06:59
by leveraging where you are to where you are now. So again y'all, I only was supposed to
7:07:05
come up here five minutes. I'm about to go teach in the VIP and platinum session, but I really wanted to come on
7:07:11
here and give you guys a little bit of game. Um, and one other thing I want to do, um, Loretta, I believe you're here.
7:07:17
Everybody who joins the VIP and platinum. Is this okay if I give you guys two of my ebooks, seven steps uh,
7:07:25
for growing Instagram and another one of my ebooks. Can I just give that to everybody who's saying, you know what, I'm in platinum and VIP. And really
7:07:31
quick, I want to let y'all know, I'm about to go speak right now on Platinum and VIP
7:07:37
the game. I'm about to show you how to attract clients like myself. My exact formula
7:07:43
and blueprint for you to go get a client that will pay you what the goal is to pay you on a monthly basis. This is what
7:07:50
I call RR, which stands for recurring revenue. So, if you're looking at this video right now, I want to say
7:07:56
congratulations. I hope you have enjoyed the first part of the summit. I know
7:08:01
I've been watching. I'm in studio. When Alicia say, are you coming to speak? I was going to do it from the home office,
7:08:07
but I said it's something about being in the room. Somebody in the chat, right? Get in the room. One of the concepts
7:08:13
that I came up with earlier is get in the room and stay in the room.
7:08:18
I need you guys to understand that you are generally a few pieces of information away from helping your
7:08:25
business save time, meeting your accountability partner, developing more workflows. Like I I need you to really
7:08:32
understand this concept y'all that your number one focus right now is how can I
7:08:38
learn as much as I can and as I learn it how can I apply it? And the reason why Alicia talks about it AI is moving at
7:08:45
the speed of AI. You know like before they say AI is moving at the speed of like if you are not taking the
7:08:52
information that you're learning and immediately execute on it I don't know what you're doing.
7:08:58
So, you don't want to miss what I'm about to teach. I'm not sure how much longer this room is going to be up, but
7:09:04
I'm about to go teach in a in a session in the other room. So, if I was you right now, like right now, I don't know
7:09:10
the link, but I would highly recommend that you take a second and upgrade.
7:09:16
Take a second. Go to what is it? AI businesssummit.com. What is it? $47, y'all. So, you can get
7:09:23
in another room where you can hear one strategy. Somebody in the chat write one.
7:09:29
I come to learn that I remember vividly, Lorett. I saw your sister at an event
7:09:37
and I was like, man, like my payroll was like crushing me, man. It's like like
7:09:42
what should I do? And I start telling her the different ways I was running my businesses. I was telling her about my
7:09:49
tech stack. I was telling her about a little bit was going on. and she says, "Um, I'll take a seat with you and tell
7:09:55
you like the things that you need to do." And she sat down with me. She started telling me the things I need to do. And I was like, "Great. Are you
7:10:01
going to do them for me?" She said, "No, I got a consultant that would do them for you." So, she ended up plugging me
7:10:08
with a consultant. And when she plugged me with this particular consultant, guys, they has been a they have helped
7:10:14
me reduce my overhead drastically, but more importantly than reducing my overhead, they've allowed me to get my
7:10:20
time back. They allow me to be able to focus on more of the things that I am good at. They allow me to focus on
7:10:26
things that allow me to grow. They allow me to spend more time with my wife and my kids. And for those don't know,
7:10:31
listen to me. I got a wife and I got five kids. I got a 20-year-old, a 5-year-old, a four-year-old, a
7:10:37
three-year-old, and a nine-month-old. And before y'all say it, yes, all by one
7:10:42
lady. Before y'all like, "Yo, he outside." No, I'm really inside. Like, I'm all the way inside, right? But guess
7:10:49
what I need more of right now? It's time. I need more of it. So the quicker
7:10:56
you execute and implement AI, the more you get time back. Imagine using
7:11:01
presentations that Imagine doing presentations that would normally take hours and now you're using gamma to do
7:11:07
it in minutes. Imagine vibe coding your app. I vividly remember one of my brothers vib not vibe coding, paying to
7:11:14
get a app done and it took well over a year or two and guess what? The app still ain't done.
7:11:20
Now people are vibe coding apps and days and this is the strategies and the games that people are teaching.
7:11:30
So why am I saying this to you all? My number one priority right now today in
7:11:36
everything that I do is how who has my who got the next piece of information for me to grow?
7:11:41
Who has the resource for me to win? Who can I uh partner up with? who can be my
7:11:47
accountability partner, who can help me grow, who can help me win. So, they are about to queue me up to go into the
7:11:52
other room, but I really want to know who am I going to see in the other room. Go to aib business.com right now. I am
7:11:59
speaking. Oh, wow. I'm about to speak. I'm about to speak. You want to be in that room
7:12:06
trust me. What I'm about to deliver, I can't even deliver it in public.
7:12:14
So, if you haven't, y'all, I will find a way to get in the room. I will find a way to be in AI fuel profits. If if
7:12:20
you're uh if you're if you're serious about saving time and putting more
7:12:26
workflows in your businesses to help you grow. But I I just want to say congratulations. I just wanted to come
7:12:31
on here and give you a quick little word before I went to speak. Um I want to say I'm excited. Uh please Lorett Michael
7:12:39
your team let me everybody know who said you know what I want to give everybody um my book at some point in time and
7:12:46
most likely you know what I'm going to do at the end of the summit y'all got a summit is all week last day everybody on
7:12:52
matter of fact I'll give everybody the books you know I just want to make sure everybody get a book I don't even like you don't even don't no purchase
7:12:58
necessary but I do recommend that you be in the VIP room y'all because I truly
7:13:03
understand what happen when you get access to more and more and more information. So, pass.
7:13:10
I'm about to go over there. I'm going to go and pass this to my sister Lorett so she can come on here and um and I see
7:13:16
she losing her voice, y'all. But she's still here. She's still showing up because she know how important it is.
7:13:22
Let me ask you this, Lorett. It's so cool this. You showed me a app
7:13:28
yesterday like, yo, I'm so excited about this. Yes. And I'm like, yo, this is pretty dope.
7:13:34
But then you also talked about a app that you paid somebody I don't know five figures for that is still not done. I
7:13:41
want you to talk really to that like like before you had to wait and depend
7:13:46
on a CTO which is a chief technology officer somebody over in in in a whole
7:13:52
different country 30 hours away that you couldn't understand their their their voice sometimes and bunch of back and
7:13:59
forth and now you're able to literally whip up a app in days like I want you to
7:14:05
talk to that. Why is that important? Um because I'm like that's just crazy right now for things that people are able to
7:14:12
do. Um I'm excited. And real quick in the chat if y'all about to come see me in VIP, somebody just write I am if I'm
7:14:19
about to see y'all cuz and I want to salute y'all. I don't know this this y'all been here for a little while.
7:14:25
So I want I want y'all to write push through because y'all still here. You still showing up. You still getting strategies and game. So it says a lot
7:14:31
about y'all growing and getting to that the level you want to get to. So Lorett, thank you my sister. let them know.
7:14:37
All right. Thank you, Mr. Nehemiah Davis. He is a marketing genius. We are blessed that he was in here sharing some
7:14:44
knowledge. Now, if you want to learn more from him, like he said, he's going to be over in the VIP room. So, if you
7:14:49
haven't upgraded yet, team, put that link in another time so they can upgrade and they can go see what he's going to
7:14:55
be dropping some gems. He just dropped that was just a little nugget, right? He's going to be dropping a whole bunch
7:15:00
of gems in that VIP room and he loves to share different strategies. So
7:15:06
definitely if you haven't upgraded yet, do it now so that you can go listen more of him. That's Nehemiah Davis. I see a
7:15:13
lot of people asking uh who was that? Who was that? Um and then the books. So the team is going to gather that
7:15:18
together. As you can see, he kind of just said it. So the team needs to gather those links, but not to worry. We will get those to you. Those are some of
7:15:25
the books that he has that about his marketing genius that he's going to share with you. So yes, I see a lot of
7:15:30
thank yous to Neo. So remember, he is over in the VIP room. if you want to continue learning with him. Now, he was
7:15:37
talking about uh he wanted me to talk about the difference with the software. So, we were actually building a software
7:15:43
$34,000 I think actually maybe more than that that we spent building this tool
7:15:48
and it took months uh has to be more than 6 months I think that it took to
7:15:54
make very long drawn out. We had another team uh building it. It was still and
7:15:59
honestly we're not going to launch it. It's actually not. It never came to fruition. It's not something I want to
7:16:05
put my name behind. So, it's that was wasted money, wasted time. But now with what Alicia is teaching and what we
7:16:11
teach in boot camp, you can build your own tools. And that's what we've done. So, we scrapped that project. Um, I'll
7:16:18
probably try to bring it next time we have the VIP room. Maybe I'll actually bring some of the screenshots and show
7:16:23
you how we spent all this money in this other tool. We don't use it. and then how I've created tools quickly in just a
7:16:30
few days on what took months and thousands of dollars to build. So that's some of the things that we teach you
7:16:36
inside AI field profits. And somebody was asking, am I going to be able to build websites? Am I going to be able to
7:16:42
build uh apps? Am I going to be able to do these different tools? Yes, you are. And those are the different things that
7:16:48
we teach you inside of the program. I see somebody saying, "Hey, I've been on since 8:00 a.m. I know this has been a
7:16:56
long day." And this is just the first day. So this is what it's going to be like. I saw somebody said if you're
7:17:01
coming to these summits, make sure that you pack your snacks, get your water because it's a long day. So get your
7:17:07
Door Dash delivered, get the babysitter because this is what you can expect for the rest of the week, which is a good
7:17:13
thing, but you know, make sure that you plan for that, that your day is going to be taken up uh with more learning and
7:17:19
more knowledge. All right, thank you so much, Lorett. Thank you so much. You all listen. Um, I see m
7:17:25
Michelle says, "I upgraded." Amazing, amazing, amazing. I love it. Um, let me
7:17:31
see there. Where is the VIP room? So, we just dropped the link in the chat. You can go to aib business.com/upgrade.
7:17:38
Aibusiness.com/upgrade if you want to join the room. I see several people trying to get VIP or
7:17:44
platinum. Uh, so they can be in the room with Nehemiah and Alisia. Alicia is actually teaching right now, I believe.
7:17:51
I peaked in there. I think she's talking about vibe coding and building these softwares and these apps. So, I think
7:17:57
that's what she's talking about right now. So, if you want to go ahead and jump in there, there's thousands of people watching and it could be uh
7:18:03

7:22:19
I don't if you're a VIP and platinum, go message our support team so we can get you in the other room. But if it is
7:22:24
there and then I'll put it in the general mission portal in just a little bit. Um Dante says, "Is this live?" Yes,
7:22:30
this is live. It is. It is. It is. All right. So, uh this is what we're Oh, go ahead.
7:22:35
One question here. So, they said if they upgrade now, do they get the recordings that they missed today? Yes, you do. So,
7:22:41
as a VIP, you get the recordings of the entire summit. So, from the beginning, we had that morning mindset. We had a
7:22:47
kickoff call. We have today's call. So, all of that comes as your recordings for the summit.
7:22:53
Yep. I love it. I love it. So, y'all listen and don't forget AI Fueled Profits is still open and available for
7:22:59
you. So, if you want to jump in there, you want to make that happen, we would love to see you inside. There's thousands of people still watching this
7:23:05
stream. So, if you need help, uh, let us know. I see Charlene is working on it. Awesome and amazing. Let me see who else
7:23:11

7:23:19
and amazing. So, if you want to get access to the program, go to getifueprofits.com.
7:23:24
But this is what I'll say today. Um, oh, wait. I see some question I want to
7:23:29
address real quick. Uh, yeah. So the books, the pocket guide is for everybody who registered. So if you haven't
7:23:35
registered, you're just watching because you found this on YouTube. You need to go to aib business.com. Okay? But we're
7:23:41
going to put all the books that were free that we mentioned, we're going to go ahead and put it inside. Okay? We're going to put inside uh your portals and
7:23:47
we'll email it to you all so you have that later on. All right? So uh one last
7:23:52
thing I'll say is so I just want to encourage everybody who who's working on it, if you're still working on getting into VIP or platinum or into AI fueled
7:23:59
profits, just let me know in the chat real quick. I want to see who's still working on it. Um, let me know. Let me know. Let me know. Um, I see we still
7:24:06
have Michelle here in the room. Linda here in the room. Cody here in the room. I love it. So, this is this is one last
7:24:12
word of, you know, kind of as we close this out because me and Lorett's been on here for an hour and a half so far. Uh,
7:24:18
I kind of want I want you to think about what's going to change in 2026.
7:24:25
One uh one time somebody told me they say, "Hey, if nothing changes, nothing's going to change." I'm like, "That sounds
7:24:31
so simple." But as I started dwelling on it, I'm like, "Oh, that's true. If I'm not intentionally changing things in my
7:24:36
life, not the outcome 6 months, 12 months down the road is not going to change." And what I've learned is
7:24:42
there's a lot of individuals I meet as I'm doing these events and I'm traveling around the the nation just doing things.
7:24:49
I hear people say, "Man, I want to I want success. I want this." I And what I I realized is Lorett, they
7:24:56
want the outcome. They want the harvest, but they're not willing to plant the seed, right? They want they want this
7:25:04
big harvest. They want the fruit off the tree, but they're not willing to plant the seed to get it. And so, if you're
7:25:09
here today, what I want to encourage you all to do is plant the seed. I'm not talking about just the seed of, you
7:25:15
know, income to get the VIP, the platinum, the a that's cool. Yeah. Plant that seed if you can, but plant the seed
7:25:22
in your life. Plant the seed of action. Plant the seed of commitment, plant the
7:25:28
seed of consistency, y'all. Because nothing works but work itself. Nothing
7:25:33
works but work itself. And so today, if you want your 2026 to look different, if
7:25:38
you want AI to change your life, it's going to start by you putting in the daily actions. It's going to start with
7:25:44
you just putting in the daily work and planting that seed. And some of y'all, you've been holding on to that seed. You
7:25:49
you want the harvest, but you've been holding on so long, you're afraid to let it go. But I just I want to encourage you to release this seed and just go all
7:25:55
in. Everybody type all in in the chat. Everybody type all in in the chat.
7:26:01
That's what I want you you all to do. No excuses.
7:26:10
Nothing. No. No. Uh maybe do it later. I want you just go all in because you can
7:26:15
either invest in your goals, your dreams, or you can
7:26:21
invest in excuses. And I know one of them pays higher dividends than the other. Only one can produce results.
7:26:30
You can't have money and you can't have excuses at the same time. It doesn't work like that.
7:26:37
And you go, I love it. There's some of y'all in here today, you're saying, "Well,
7:26:42
I'll just go get this off of I'll watch the replay off YouTube." Guess what? This YouTube for general mission, it's
7:26:47
getting archived right after this call. Team, don't let me forget that. This is
7:26:53
This is getting archived right after this call. So, if you think you're going to go back watch this, it ain't happening,
7:26:59
right? And so, we are gonna This is only the replay will only be for VIP and platinum.
7:27:04
So, I want to encourage you all today as we end this out. It's just like go all in on yourself. Run the plays. Change.
7:27:10
Don't let 2026 be the same as last year. Don't let this year that you're living
7:27:16
in right now, at the end of it, you say, "Yo, man, nothing changed. Nothing was different." I want you to look back and
7:27:22
say, "Wow, 2026 was my pivotal year. 2026 was my year where you know what?
7:27:29
Everything changed for me." And the only person that can make that decision to really make that happen is
7:27:37
you. Alisia can't come in person and hold your hand and do this. We can
7:27:42
provide the curriculum like the AI fuel profits. We can come in here and do our best to to support you, but it's going
7:27:49
to start with you taking the leap and planting the seed. Just like I'm going
7:27:54
to shout out a few people that said they were going to do that by jumping into the program. There's sever there's several people that I see that have
7:28:01
worked on I seen Tmaine got VIP and say you know what I'm getting in this thing no matter what. Dr. Wilton says I'm
7:28:07
jumping in. Camille says I'm jumping into VIP so I don't miss the boat and I'm going to plant the seed.
7:28:13
Somebody says is the VIP room recorded is yeah the VIP and platinum. You're going to receive a portal, right, Lorett? They're going to receive a
7:28:20
portal that has every single session. I think it's going to be Let's Let's just do the math real quick. The sneak peek

7:28:44
Like, how are you frantically taking notes? How would you really realistically
7:28:50
learn like absorb all of that information? You can't. That's too much information. Especially if this stuff is
7:28:56
new things to you, you need to have VIP. And just like Michael said, let this be the change, right? Let this be the
7:29:02
change. Let 2026 be the year that you make a difference. And we want to be there with you. We want to put your name
7:29:08

AI to Indonesia. What she's teaching literally make a difference.
7:32:23
She always takes that extra care to actually thoroughly explain and she

makes sure her community also carries that same vibe and that same energy. And I love that. Everybody out there that's
7:32:34

7:33:32
How many times I'm saying the whole touch
7:33:38
in the back of the room in the back of the room? Put this girl in the back.
7:33:45
Hey, it's Lisia Little, your AI coach and trainer. I'm here with our amazing
7:33:51
group of AI consultants. Hey everybody.
7:33:57
I don't need no phone. I don't need to follow you. You know me, I'm vibing. You
7:34:04
and me are vibing. Always catch you vibing.
7:34:10
Today we're doing the AI Inerson experience with my consultants here in Atlanta. And let me tell you something,
7:34:15
it has been an amazing day. I just love the fact that we're networking with each
7:34:21
other, talking to each other, and then really figuring out how we can all win with AI. If you're not in the AI
7:34:26
consultants program, you need to check it out. This is a program that I love. It's really close to my heart. We're
7:34:32
going into the third year for our AI certified consultants program. This will
7:34:37
probably be the biggest revolution that you will experience in your lifetime. If you're not all in yet, you will be now.
7:34:44
So, jump in, join us, and I look forward to seeing you on the inside. Bye for now. moments like this. This is how it
7:34:52
grows. This is how we kiss. I just want to give a little brief
7:34:59
synopsis about the in-person experience today. If I tell you, you missed
7:35:07
a very very uh exciting event. It was great to be here. I mean, this wonderful
7:35:13
surrounding um just made the whole thing perfect. And I want to actually thank
7:35:20
Alicia and her sister and also Mr. Neo Davis.
7:35:26
This experience was phenomenal. This whole AI revolution, it's a game changer. It's not it's not
7:35:33
something that you need to brush to the side. It is everything. And what I would
7:35:39
say is what I gained from it is that 2026
7:35:45
it's all about execution. It's one thing to gain information and and talk about a whole lot of the
7:35:52
improvements with AI, but if you don't execute anything, it's not going to serve you at all. So what I gained out
7:35:59
of this is execute, execute, execute.
7:36:05
I help entrepreneurs, small businesses to improve their income while using AI.
7:36:11
At this AI event with Alysio, my mind was blown. I thought I knew enough about
7:36:18
AI, but I've learned so many tools and instruments to be using. One thing I will definitely implement today is to
7:36:27
make sure that I go live every day. Um,
7:36:32
that's something that I normally shy away from. I even created a clone myself, but while she's out there
7:36:38
working, I should be doing it, too. So, I could really interact with my audience and get to know them better and to
7:36:44
service them, learn little things about them. That's another note that I learned from Neo is to learn just a little
7:36:50
things about them because that's where the connection starts. And I'm so grateful for this opportunity and I
7:36:56
would this would not be my last. Thank you. I am super like
7:37:03
my brain is bursting with amazingness. Alicia, Alisia, Alisia, my AI mama, the
7:37:10
queen of AI. She has outdone herself once again. I learned two new tools. I didn't even know I was coming to learn
7:37:16
tools cuz you know I got a big tool kit. But today, baby, she put us on the game Google Notebook LM. Complete and total
7:37:24
game changer, especially for educators. Amazing. Big View Teleprompter app. But if y'all don't have it, y'all need to
7:37:30
get it. If y'all do content, game changer. This lady is on fire, guys. She
7:37:35
is flipping the planet upside down with AI. We are all in with AI, and you should be, too. This was an amazing
7:37:42
event. Thank you, Neo, for hosting us. We love you so much. Without Neo, I never would have found Alicia. So,
7:37:48
together, they are my dream team mentor, coach duo, and I am so blessed and
7:37:54
grateful to be a part of this program. Let me say this to you. I have flown all the way from Detroit down here to
7:38:00
Atlanta last minute to make sure that I was in the house today to hear Alicia and Neo talk about the things that they
7:38:05
talked about today. I am so sold on AI because of the way Alicia teaches this stuff. The way she gives it makes it
7:38:12
hands-on, makes it accessible, makes you know that you can do it. And not only can you do it for yourself, but you can
7:38:17
go out and help other people change their lives. This event today for me has been monumental. I'm looking forward to
7:38:23
the exact next time I can get together, be in the presence of these people. Why? because it's going to help so many more
7:38:28
people to grasp onto AI and to do the things that they need to do to make their lives the very best they've ever
7:38:34
been. I'm telling you, I had a blast today at the AI consultant experience. I mean, it
7:38:41
was a treat. I mean, we started off with, you know, breakfast. They had us and we had breakfast and um which was
7:38:48
wonderful. And then we had the podcast. Um, that podcast was just amazing to
7:38:54
have that experience live. And then we had a master class downstairs and I
7:39:00
walked away with some nuggets. I walked away with meeting some sisters, some brothers and I'm just thrilled to see
7:39:06
what's to come and I'm excited about everything that I've learned today and
7:39:12
just just propelling just taking off like a rocket. And Alicia has transformed my life when it comes to the AI game. The things that
7:39:19
we are implementing within the childcare industry is going to be amazing, unstoppable. What I learned right now,
7:39:25
we're networking. We're networking with a lot of people is amazing. At least you just knocked it out the box. So, I wish
7:39:32
that anyone that wants to learn or not say wish, I I just want to let you guys
7:39:38
know if you want to learn more about AI, she is the one for it. This is a program. Everyone here is like family.
7:39:44
Everyone here was amazing. So definitely locked in and just level up. I first saw Alicia on Facebook and from
7:39:53
there I attended the virtual summit and then I joined the AI consultant program
7:39:59
where I have learned so much information in a very short period of time. Alicia is the vessel of change and if you are
7:40:06
on the fence about joining the Casulta program, don't be. Do it now. Do it
7:40:12
fast. Thanks. Today, let me tell you, today was amazing. I learned so much. I
7:40:20
think the number one thing that I learned was that I cannot put myself down. I'm worth something and I have to
7:40:27
tell people about it.
7:40:55
I've been around AI and technology for a very long time. The way Alysia has
7:41:01
situated and created this beautiful environment ecosystem for us to learn
7:41:07
in, it has not only changed my life, it's changed my daughter's life. It's going to change my mom's life. It's
7:41:13
going to change my aunt's life. I'm overjoyed and I'm grateful. So, so very grateful. Thank you. Thank you.
7:41:18
The most impactful part about being here, I feel like success low speed. I was able to just see a lot of the systems that I want to implement in my
7:41:24
business. Today, I got enough time to to seed boy time for the whole year. It was value after value after value after value. The
7:41:31
experience was shoot was the boss elevated creme deer creme. We just had to be in the building and he had to be
7:41:36
in the room. Today's event was just very impactful. I really can't even put words on it. The amount of information I got with Alicia
7:41:43
and then all the guest speakers. Next level is Alicia has changed my life
7:41:50
in ways that you could never imagine. I'm a video producer and editor. Alisma's live event has been amazing to
7:41:59
help give me some groundwork, give me the foundation of learning AI technology. It's been working from day
7:42:05
one. I power circle. Yes, taking the next level. I'm in all
7:42:11
of their programs. AI club, AI consulting, power circle mastermind.
7:42:16
It's something you can't miss. AI is the future. Networking has been the thing
7:42:23
that's important for all businesses. We're in a room. If you haven't joined
7:42:28
any of Alicia program, get in them now.
7:42:33
work the room, put people into buckets and take the offic.
7:42:45
This gives me more insight into how I can upscale even that part of my
7:42:50
business as the ambulance guy. So now I can not only see how I can upscale my business, but maybe teach you how to be
7:42:57
a seven figure earner. and the admit it. Uh the little sisters have been wonderful, have been very inspiring. I'm
7:43:05
so happy to be in the room with all these great power who want to do AI
7:43:11
technology and work on the next generation of being
7:43:17
in the world. Not just in their in their cities, but just in the world.
7:43:22
This community has personally and professionally impacted me in so many different ways. Not just changing my
7:43:27
income, but changing my mindset, knowing what you can actually do with AI and getting ahead of the wave. All the
7:43:33
different opportunities that actually exist between like getting your productivity together, increasing your
7:43:39
income. I'm super grateful to be inside of the room. I know for a fact that this is the place that we need to be. A poet, creative storyteller,
7:43:46
professional problem solver. I already use AI in my life every day. Like it's my best friend. I nickname everything.
7:43:53
Right. today gave me motivation to learn more, get more into it, go all in, be
7:43:58
more open-minded about how to not only use it for myself, but even more in my everyday life.
7:44:04
This was my first time attending the AI fuel property events. Listen, my background is IT and cyber security.
7:44:10
I've been in the military for 28 years. If you have not gotten into anything AI,
7:44:17
you are wrong. If you're looking to scale businesses, catapult your life, catapult businesses connected to you,
7:44:23
you need to get in AI like yesterday. Okay, the time is now. All in for AI.
7:44:29
I represent my own company by the way of inspiration from Alicia. My company is
7:44:34
actually called Platinum AI Consulting Agency. I find it electrifying because
7:44:39
it keeps igniting different ideas of understanding how to transform better ways of utilizing the technology with AI
7:44:47
and it just makes you just excited. The more you think about it, the more money you can earn. Just the different ideas
7:44:52
and just knowing that AI is working for you. You're just prompting everything. It makes you just super electrified.
7:44:58
This is phenomenal. It has taken AI to a totally different level. The things that you can do with AI just there's no words
7:45:05
to describe it. that has done for me. It has changed my life and it has taken my
7:45:11
business to a totally different level and this has been truly amazing. I have
7:45:17
been in it for over 24 years but this is pivotal. AI is changing my life.
7:45:24
You have got to make this a priority for you in your life because this right here
7:45:30
will get you to many different levels in your life. No matter where you are, no matter what you do, this will be a game
7:45:37
changer for you. It has given me the tools that I need to be a seven figure
7:45:43
earner and I am not even in it. This is amazing. Alicia Little and her crew have
7:45:48
given me prompts, advice and structure to reach my seven figures. You got to try it.
7:45:54
I am a serial entrepreneur. This event is powerful filled with so so so so much
7:46:00
information in gyms and tools that are needed for us as a people today to move
7:46:06
forward in a world that we now have access. All I can say get in the room. Whenever there is an AI innovation
7:46:13
experience done by Alisa Little and Lorissa Little, get in the room.
7:46:19
Proximity is what matters. And don't listen to the naysayers because the
7:46:24
naysayers will kill your dream. So get in the room and be a part of AI
7:46:32
innovation. Remove at the speed of AI. This is amazing. an amazing summit and one word
7:46:39
to describe it would be lifechanging because it opened up doors there were clothes I knew nothing about and
7:46:45
learning everything AI I feel like I have a personal assistant and a new career
7:46:50
Atlanta it was the best decision I have made ever I am so excited I'm so excited
7:46:57
about being here everything not only that I've learned here all the goodies I
7:47:03
got but the information that has empowered me to take it home change the rest of my life. Alicia, thank you so
7:47:10
much. Thank you so much. An absolute amazing day. I'm glad I stayed. I'm very new to the consultant program.
7:47:17
You know, if I can't stop thinking about this consulting program, then I'm going to go in. I'm all in. There's no turning
7:47:24
back. And I just created my first offering just now. So, I'm in.
7:47:31
In one session, I've learned how to create their own GPT. I've learned how to create an agent and it worked. And
7:47:38
also last week we did something with the kids and my four years old and my seven
7:47:44
years old were able to create books that they brought to the school and they even gift to all the the people in the class.
7:47:51
So definitely recommend and also recommend to join the consultants.
7:47:56
I feel that if we follow the lead, if we follow what we've been given, the sky is
7:48:03
the limit. Amazing. Amazing information, a great way to make tons of money. Honestly,
7:48:08
listen, with AI, you can do it faster, quicker, uh, better, deeper, it's so
7:48:14
many different things. And let me tell you about the living system. They created a community where people help each other. Not only is it that they
7:48:21
give us the good information, they give us the timely information, and they do it in a way that brings community
7:48:27
together. You want to learn from number four, number five, number six, or you want to learn from number one or number
7:48:33
two, and she's not number two. I learned that today. So, listen. I don't know what it is you want to do, but you need
7:48:38
to make it to whatever the little sisters are doing because they're doing it in a way that you get what you need,
7:48:45
they get what they need, and you're equipped to give other people what they want. I have to admit, um, I had my
7:48:51
doubts as to how much I would really get out of it, but the truth of the matter is is every second of it was well worth
7:48:58
it. The fact that we get to do it handson with the tables here, follow along, put into practice, invaluable.
7:49:06
I've attended even other other trainings, but it was uh definitely
7:49:11
worth it to be able to be here. And the connections that I made with others in person, being able to exchange ideas and
7:49:18
implement them on the spot, that's incomparable and I highly recommend it to anybody. Uh Alicia and Lorett,
7:49:24
they're the real deal. Don't miss out. But I'm super excited because the little sisters are getting me trained. I'm
7:49:30
going to be an AI consultant expert. They've already given me access to a gig
7:49:36
with NASA. So, I just want to spread the love that you can do it, too. And you can only do it with the little sisters
7:49:41
because they're the best in the business. So, I'm super excited. I met my sister in cyber here at AI Fuel
7:49:48
Profit. So, guess what we're going to do? We're going to expand our knowledge together. I am in IT and cyber security and I'm
7:49:56
expanding into AI and I'm looking to go and help all the people do all the
7:50:01
things. I uh just joined the power circle and um I'm ready to just take off in my business and help others. So also
7:50:09
the little sisters likeing amazing super super amazing like we love you.
7:50:15
And so I want to say thank you to Lorett and I want to say thank you to Alicia and even though I talk a lot and I love
7:50:21
people and I know my purpose, Lorett, you are the introvert. You truly uh keep
7:50:27
this extrovert on his toes. But I want to say thank you uh for helping me regain confidence in myself as a coach
7:50:32
and as a consultant. And uh the community, oh my god, the community, man, you guys encourages me. So I want
7:50:38
to say thank you uh from the top to the bottom of my heart. So do never underestimate yourself and think you're
7:50:44
not until you finish. You are right now that consultant. You are an AI consultant. And then Alicia is and
7:50:52
through the program when you finish, you're going to be a certified consultant. So keep going. Hang in there. Breathe. and keep dreaming and
7:51:00
keep going. To me, the two of them are the queens of AI. As a matter of fact, um I've
7:51:07
purchased a couple of courses to learn AI with other providers, but I actually
7:51:12
took Alysia's course. I've purchased others, but hers is the only one that I
7:51:18
actually took from beginning to end. To me, it says a lot about how she resonates with the information. She's
7:51:26
credible and I love her facilitation style. I see a little of me in her and
7:51:33
so seeing her lead the way in this field makes the goal look attainable for me.
7:51:38
AI to me is brand new but I'm all in because of the support Alisia Little and
7:51:45
her sister Loretta Little as granted. They are amazing. Do the jump y'all. I'm
7:51:52
doing it here. You can do it too. Let's do this together. They will guide you in
7:51:57
every step of the way. Do not be afraid. Alicia and they they've been a blessing
7:52:02
to my family. It's like um I just can't believe that this opportunity has came upon us. It's like something that you
7:52:08
just really got to jump into. Like I urge everybody to like get into it as soon as possible. You know, this is an awesome opportunity and you got to
7:52:14
really take yourself and like join us right now. Drop everything and just join. Thank you. Right. I'm like 3 4 in one. I'm
7:52:21
searching your name. Whoever show you was on, I was on it. Right. And so faith and AI is my thing, right? Church. Yeah.
7:52:28
I'm I'm a pastor, so I'm going crazy. Right. So here it is. I'm like,
7:52:34
let me see if I can build a website for the church. On behalf of the power circle, we just want to say thank you for lifting us
7:52:40
higher. Thank you for believing in us. Thank you for reminding us that little by little, or should I say little by
7:52:47
little, great, greatness grows. Okay.
7:52:54
Alicia, she's the bomb, man. She knows what she's talking about. AI is everything. AI is the future. AI is the
7:53:01
now. Alicia Little's event, an icon when it comes to AI. Trust me on this. She's not
7:53:07
just a queen of AI. She owned this space. It has been a mindblowing program and
7:53:13
anytime I get time with that group, I'm going to learn something. I am a professor and children's book
7:53:19
author. Already built my own agent. Her name is Justice. She's a cute girly. She's going to be helping me with my
7:53:24
social media. So, if you haven't checked out what Alicia offers, do so ASAP. ASAP. ASAP.
7:53:30
Me being a IT professional almost 20 years, she inspired me to learn more about AI. The way she presented it, the
7:53:36
way I learned numeral things, AI is probably going to be the best invention that we ever had in a long time. So, if
7:53:41
you don't know what AI, you're going to be left behind. I'm here at the AI summit with my business. that it can be 10x due to the
7:53:48
fact that operating on its own pretty much once you set that foundation and that's what Alysia has given us. I
7:53:54
admire Alysia as the AI queen. I love AI. I call AI a thought partner.
7:54:00
I'm a marketing photographer and consultant and I see the value what AI
7:54:05
can do for individuals that that want to increase their productivity. Here today to support Alicia Little. She
7:54:11
is empowering us all in the AI industry. super grateful and had the opportunity to talk about AI, learn about AI, and
7:54:18
it's really going to help grow my business 10 times because of Alicia. Everything that we do is going to be impacted by artificial intelligence. So,
7:54:25
I'm here today to learn how to prompt AI and do some great things to enhance my life, my work style, and my work life
7:54:31
balance. Alicia and the whole team, she is killing it in the AI space.
7:54:36
AI consultant and software engineer. I came out to the AI impact tour today to
7:54:41
level up my skills. Of course, I love technology. I came out to meet Alicia. It is
7:54:47
lifechanging being in the room with her. Anybody that get in this profession, it doesn't matter what industry, you can
7:54:52
10x your business quickly. I'm attending the uh impact tour here in Atlanta. I've learned so much.
7:54:59
Definitely a blessing. I found Alicia through the Earn Your Leisure podcast. Signed up for one of her free summits
7:55:06
and learned an amazing amount of information and ready to go and I'm looking forward to the future in AI. I
7:55:11
met Alysia at the Women in Construction Engineering and Real Estate Conference.
7:55:16
And so I am so glad I found Alisia. She has been just phenomenal with trainings,
7:55:22
podcasts, and just all the things that she's doing with Neo. Uh I love her and
7:55:28
everything that she's doing. And so I have my own consultancy. And so I can't
7:55:33
wait for everything that she's doing. And I'm so glad that I was at that conference and I met Alicia. I found
7:55:39
Alicia on Instagram. When I found her on Instagram, I immediately went to the AI
7:55:44
field profits and have not stopped since. I joined the AI consultancy group. I'm just a couple of weeks away
7:55:50
from getting my certification and I am all in on AI. So, I encourage you to do
7:55:55
so, too. I met Alysia through Nemiah uh podcast. I um actually, you know, joined that uh
7:56:04
AIP of Prophets the same day I watched the uh the show with Nehemiah. So um
7:56:11
it's been a roller coaster ever since. I'm glad that I watched that uh podcast
7:56:16
because now I feel like I've entered the money train because there are so many
7:56:22
opportunities so wide open and um I've already had some few projects in the
7:56:28
pipeline that I'm working on. I have a real estate background for over 20 years. I have a background trading
