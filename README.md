## 👩🏾‍💼 About the Founder

**Charlene-Maria: Grant** is the founder and guiding light behind **Affirmed Visionary**, a UK-based movement dedicated to empowering Black women and women of colour through healing, entrepreneurship, and holistic self-expression. She is a:

- 🧠 **Soft Productivity Coach** – helping individuals make meaningful progress with compassion and clarity  
- 🤖 **AI Consultant** – guiding ethical, empowering use of AI tools for creatives and small business owners  
- 👩🏾‍🏫 **Qualified Teacher** – with experience delivering education that uplifts, engages, and transforms  
- 🧑🏾‍💻 **Full Stack Software Engineer** – building digital systems that work for the people they serve  
- 🎨 **Graphic Designer** – creating beautiful, functional visuals that align with emotional and strategic goals

On **June 28th, 2025**, she launched the **Visionary in Progress** community—a Skool-based space for healing and business-building with a soul. It was created not just as a learning platform, but as a refuge, a network, and a rebellion against systems that marginalise and exploit.

Charlene operates across multiple platforms to provide:
- Journals, affirmations, and planning tools for emotional resilience  
- DFY digital products and educational templates with resell rights  
- Community-focused spaces rooted in healing-centred leadership  
- Courses, coaching, and guidance in digital product creation and mindful tech use  

With **Affirmed Visionary Publishes**, Charlene documents not just her creative journey, but a **protective paper trail**. It’s a testament to her accountability, transparency, and care for herself, her intellectual property, and the women she serves.

> “This work is not just about building. It's about protecting, archiving, and honouring everything we’re creating—for today and for those who come after.”
